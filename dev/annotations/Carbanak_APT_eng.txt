<heading> 1. Executive Summary </heading>
From late 2013 onwards, several banks and financial institutions have been
attacked by an unknown group of cybercriminals. In all these attacks, a similar
modus operandi was used. According to victims and the law enforcement
agencies (LEAs) involved in the investigation, this could result in cumulative
losses of up to 1 billion USD. The attacks are still active.
This report provides a technical analysis of these attacks.
The motivation for the attackers, who are making use of techniques commonly
seen in Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), appears to be financial gain as
opposed to espionage.
An analysis of the campaign has revealed that the initial infections were
achieved using spear phishing emails that appeared to be legitimate banking
communications, with Microsoft Word 97 – 2003 (.doc) and Control Panel Applet
(.CPL) files attached. We believe that the attackers also redirected to exploit kits
website traffic that related to financial activity.
The email attachments exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office 2003, 2007 and
2010 (CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2013-3906) and Microsoft Word (CVE-2014-
1761). Once the vulnerability is successfully exploited, the shellcode decrypts
and executes the backdoor known as Carbanak.
Carbanak is a remote backdoor (initially based on Carberp), designed for
espionage, data exfiltration and to provide remote access to infected machines.
Once access is achieved, attackers perform a manual reconnaissance of the
victim’s networks. Based on the results of this operation, the attackers use
different lateral movement tools in order to get access to the critical systems
in the victim´s infrastructure. They then install additional software such as the
Ammyy Remote Administration Tool, or even compromise SSH servers. Notably,
some of the latest versions of the analyzed Carbanak malware appear not to use
any Carberp source code.
Once the attackers successfully compromise the victim´s network, the primary
internal destinations are money processing services, Automated Teller Machines
(ATM) and financial accounts. In some cases, the attackers used the Society for
Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) network to transfer
money to their accounts. In others, Oracle databases were manipulated to open
payment or debit card accounts at the same bank or to transfer money between

<header> 4 </header>


accounts using the online banking system. The ATM network was also used to
dispense cash from certain ATMs at certain times where money mules were ready
to collect it.
As part of the attack´s reconnaissance phase, video recordings of the activities of
bank employees, particularly system administrators, were made. The videos were
sent to the C2 server.
Please note that the attackers abused the aforementioned services by
impersonating legitimate local users who had the permissions to perform the
actions later reproduced by the cybercriminals. As far as we know, none of the
aforementioned services were attacked nor was any specific vulnerability within
them exploited.
Of the 100 banking entities impacted at the time of writing this report, at least
half have suffered financial losses, with most of the victims located in Russia,
USA, Germany, China and Ukraine. The magnitude of the losses is significant.
For example, one victim lost approximately $7.3 million (USD) due to ATM fraud;
another suffered a $10 million (USD) loss due to the exploitation of its online
banking platform.
Stolen funds were transferred out of the affected countries to bank accounts in
the US and China. Additionally some of the C2 servers have log entries indicating
connections to systems located in the US. Telemetry indicates that the attackers
are expanding operations to other regions, such as Asia, the Middle-East, Africa
and Europe.
This report discusses the attack vectors, infection mechanisms and toolkits used
by the attackers to exploit the network after the initial infection, as well as the
operational details and geographical distribution of this campaign.

<heading> 2. Analysis </heading>
During the spring of 2014, Kaspersky Lab was involved in a forensic analysis
of ATMs dispensing cash to people located near them but with no physical
interaction according to security cameras. No malware was detected on these
ATMs. However, Carberp-like malware was found on a computer that was
connected to them via VPN.
Following the investigation of this incident, in the summer of 2014, Kaspersky
Lab identified the same Carberp-like malware in another investigation involving
a bank, where criminals were able to gain access to its online banking systems.
In this investigation, we started analyzing all the computers in the bank’s
infrastructure in order to find the source of the infection. We found spear phishing
emails with CPL files attached that, after a successful infection, install the same
Carberp-like malware we had previously found in the case involving the ATMs.
There is evidence indicating that in most cases the network was compromised
for between two to four months, and that many hundreds of computers within a
single victim organization may have been infected. This period of time was used
by the attackers to get access to the right victims and critical systems, and to
learn how to operate their tools and systems to get the cash out.
Carbanak contains an espionage component that allows the attackers to take
control of video capabilities on the victim systems. Thanks to this, long term
observation and reconnaissance could be conducted. This allowed the attackers
to understand the protocols and daily operational tempo of their targets. Based
on this understanding, exploitation methodologies and mechanisms were
developed and tailored to each victim.

<heading> 2.1 Infection and Transmission </heading>
All observed cases used spear phishing emails with Microsoft Word 97 – 2003
(.doc) files attached or CPL files. The doc files exploit both Microsoft Office (CVE-
2012-0158 and CVE-2013-3906) and Microsoft Word (CVE- 2014-1761).
There are indicators that point to a possible Chinese origin for the exploits used
in these attachments. Command and Control (C2) servers located in China have
been identified in this campaign. In addition, registration information for some of
the domains use details of supposedly Chinese citizens. Obviously, all this could
just be a red herring.

The targets were all employees affiliated to the affected institution. The spear
phishing email messages appeared legitimate and in some cases were sent from
compromised coworkers´ accounts. In this way compromised systems were used
as a transmission vector.
Given that the victims were mostly Russian-speaking financial institutions,
the names of the attachments we have identified were generally in Russian.
Examples include “Соответствие ФЗ-115” and “Приглашение” which translate
into “Accordance to Federal Law” and “Invitation” respectively. This is enough to
induce a typical employee to open the attachment and execute the malware. For
a complete list of file names see Appendix 4.
The following is an example of a Carbanak spear phishing email:




Translated:




In this case, the attachment was a CPL file compressed using the Roshal Archive
(.rar) format.
Once the remote code execution vulnerability is successfully exploited, it installs
Carbanak on the victim's system. The complete list of observed spear phishing
emails can be found in Appendix 1 – Spear phishing.
An additional infection vector that we believe was used by the criminals is
a classical drive-by-download attack. We have found traces of the Null and
the RedKit exploits kits.

<heading> 2.2 Malware Analysis – Backdoor.Win32.Carbanak </heading>
Carbanak is a backdoor used by the attackers to compromise the victim's machine
once the exploit, either in the spear phishing email or exploit kit, successfully
executes its payload. This section provides a functional analysis of Carbanak’s
capabilities.
Carbanak copies itself into “%system32%\com” with the name “svchost.exe” with
the file attributes: system, hidden and read-only. The original file created by the
exploit payload is then deleted.
To ensure that Carbanak has autorun privileges the malware creates a new
service. The naming syntax is “<ServiceName>Sys” where ServiceName is any
existing service randomly chosen, with the first character deleted. For example,
if the existing service´s name is “aspnet” and the visible name is “Asp.net state



<footer> TLP: White	                 For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com </footer>

<header> 8 </header>


service”, the service created by the malware would be “aspnetSys” with a visible
name of “Sp.net state service”.
Before creating the malicious service, Carbanak determines if either the avp.exe
or avpui.exe processes (components of Kaspersky Internet Security) is running.
If found on the target system, Carbanak will try to exploit a known vulnerability
in Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008,
Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012, CVE-2013-3660, for local
privilege escalation. We believe this is not relevant and that the attackers adapt
their tools to the victim´s defenses.
Carbanak creates a file with a random name and a .bin extension in
%COMMON_APPDATA%\Mozilla where it stores commands to be executed.
Then the malware gets the proxy configuration from the registry entry:
[HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings]
and the Mozilla Firefox configuration file in:
%AppData%\Mozilla\Firefox\<ProfileName>\prefs.js

    How to detect Carbanak
    One of the best methods for detecting Carbanak is to look for .bin files in the
    folder:
    ..\All users\%AppData%\Mozilla\
    The malware saves files in this location that will later be sent to the C2 server
    when an internet connection is detected.
    A .BAT script for detecting infections is provided in the Appendixes.

Additionally, Carbanak can obtain proxy configuration information from headers
sent through an application via SOCKS or HTTP.
Carbanak injects its code into svchost.exe. Most of the actions described below
happen within this process.
Carbanak downloads the file kldconfig.plug from its C2 server. This file includes
the names of the processes to be monitored.
Once the system is infected, Carbanak logs keystrokes and takes screenshots
every 20 seconds. This monitoring is performed by intercepting the
ResumeThread call.

<header>                                                                                               9 </header>


To enable connections to the infected computer using the Remote Desktop
Protocol (RDP), Carbanak sets Termservice service execution mode to Auto. Also,
after executing this service, it modifies the executable code in memory in order to
establish simultaneous work processes for both remote and local users. Modules
modified in this process are: termsrv.dll, csrsrv.dll, msgina.dll and winlogon.exe.
If Carbanak detects the banking application BLIZKO (funds transfer software) in
the infected computer, it sends a special notification to its C2 server. Carbanak
is also aware of the IFOBS banking application and can, on command, substitute
the details of payment documents in the IFOBS system.
To communicate with its C2 server, Carbanak uses the HTTP protocol with
RC2+Base64 encryption, adding additional characters not included in Base64.
It also inserts strings with different extensions (.gif,.htm, etc.) at random locations
in the HTTP request.
Example of a typical Carbanak request:




Carbanak sends its collected monitoring data to its C2 server. It also receives
commands. The commands are compared with a hash table; if there is a match
Carbanak performs the associated action:

<heading> 2.3 Lateral movement tools </heading>
Carbanak uses different tools on infected systems, each one with a different
purpose. There appears to be a preference for the Ammyy Admin remote
administration tool for remote control. Specifically, the attackers have been
detected uploading:
  Ammyy Admin 3.5 (f8cd52b70a11a1fb3f29c6f89ff971ec) as svchost.exe
It is believed that the attackers used this remote administration tool because
it is commonly whitelisted in the victims’ environments as a result of being
used regularly by administrators.
In another instance, a Secure Shell (SSH) backdoor was used to communicate
with the C2 server in 190.97.165.126 (operatemesscont.net).
This indicates that the attackers did not limit themselves to Microsoft Windows
environments. In this case, the victim used the Telnet/SSH client PuTTY to
connect to the server, and the attackers recompiled the machine’s SSH daemon
with a backdoor so they could gain direct access.
Logs for these tools indicate that they were accessed from two different IPs,
probably used by the attackers, and located in Ukraine and France.
We have also found traces of many different tools used by the attackers inside
the victim´s network to gain control of additional systems, such as Metasploit,
PsExec or Mimikatz.

<heading> 2.4 Command and Control (C2) Servers </heading>
There appear to be four distinct types of C2 servers:
<list>
•	 Linux servers used for issuing commands to deployed Carbanak instances
   and for receiving collected monitoring data;
•	 Windows servers used for remote connections to victim systems;
•	 Backup servers; and
•	 Drop servers where additional executable files (e.g. remote administration
   tools) are hosted.
</list>
Server rotation occurs more or less on a biweekly basis. For a complete list of
identified Carbanak servers please check the regularly updated Carbanak IOC
document. The current list of IOCs is provided at Appendix 3 in his document.
Some of these C2 servers are responsible for dropping Ammyy (configuration
and executable files), the KLG plugin configuration (list of processes to monitor)
and the VNC server (both 32 and 64 bits to be injected in rundll). In one of the
observed servers there was also a Metasploit module.

Victim systems are catalogued in the servers’ databases. The victims belong
to a number of different communities, thus simplifying administration. In all,
85 different victims belonging to seven communities were found.

<heading> Attacker´s operational details </heading>
Additionally, the malicious servers contain video files that capture a victim´s
activity. While the videos are stored using a compressed format which provides
poor image quality, the selected format minimizes upload bandwith and is of
sufficient quality for the attackers to understand the victims’ activities.
The video file naming conventions used the name of the application in the
foreground (e.g., Outlook, Cmd, etc.) and only recorded user activity. This helped
the attackers to both navigate to files of interest and to discard superfluous files.




      <figure></figure> <caption> Figure 14. Special video player designed to watch Carbanak´s video stream </caption>
Using the intelligence gained from video and other monitoring techniques, the
attackers developed an operational picture of the victim's workflow, tooling and
practices. This picture helps the attackers to deploy their malicious operations,
for example:
<list>
•	 Attackers created fake transactions in the victim’s internal database after
    the verification process, thus avoiding discovery of the fraudulent activity;
•	 Attackers used the victim’s internal command utilities to insert fraudulent
    operations in the transaction queue.
</list>
In general, the attackers demonstrated great versatility, using attack
methodologies best suited to a specific victim’s operational methodology.
However, they seemed to deliberately limit the amount of money stolen per
victim to $10 million USD. This limit may be explained as the maximum amount

of money that can be transferred via mule services, or the maximum amount of
money that is budgeted in banks for fraud risks in order to minimize the chances
of LEAs and the bank´s anti-fraud teams from doing a full blown analysis.




                      <figure></figure> <caption> Figure 15. List of PIN KVC used on ATMs </caption>
Sensitive bank documents have be found on the servers that were controlling
Carbanak. They included classified emails, manuals, crypto keys, passwords
and so on. For example, the file in the above figure has KVC (key verification codes)
keys that are used by ATMs to check the integrity of the PIN numbers of its users.
In other cases involving ATMs, the criminals were able to control computers that
had access to the internal ATM network. If the bank had enabled remote access
to ATMs, the criminals started using this access to remotely withdraw cash.
Criminals used no malware to operate the ATM dispenser; instead they used
standard utilities to control and test ATM equipment.

<heading> 3. Conclusions </heading>
Malware targeting the finance industry (both companies and consumers)
continues to evolve. The Carbanak malware used in the on-going campaign
described in this report has been very successful in terms of generating
revenue. Of particular interest are the attack methods, similar to those used
in sophisticated cyber-espionage APTs. As such, they represent a new and
disturbing trend in the cybercrime market of increasing attack sophistication.
Despite increased awareness of cybercrime within the financial services sector,
it appears that spear phishing attacks and old exploits (for which patches have
been disseminated) remain effective against larger companies. Attackers always
use this minimal effort approach in order to bypass a victim´s defenses.
Advanced control and fraud detection systems have been used for years by the
financial services industry. However, these focus on fraudulent transactions within
customer accounts. The Carbanak attackers bypassed these protections, by for
example, using the industry-wide funds transfer (the SWIFT network), updating
balances of account holders and using disbursement mechanisms (the ATM network).
In neither of these cases did the attackers exploit a vulnerability within the
service. Instead, they studied the victim´s internal procedures and pinpointed
who they should impersonate locally in order to process fraudulent transactions
through the aforementioned services.
It is clear that the attackers were very familiar with financial services software
and networks. As part of an automated reconnaissance phase, the Carbanak
malware checked victim systems for the presence of specialized and specific
banking software. Only after the presence of banking systems was confirmed,
were victims further exploited. To date, attacks against approximately 300 IP
addresses around the world have been observed on analyzed C2s. It is possible
that these attacks were coordinated to maximize returns prior to industry-wide
information sharing and the implementation of countermeasures.
Existing telemetry indicates that the Carbanak attackers are trying to expand
operations to other Baltic and Central Europe countries, the Middle East, Asia
and Africa. Carbanak may be responsible for losses as high as $1 billion USD.
We believe that the Carbanak campaign is a clear indicator of a new era in
cybercrime in which criminals use APT techniques directly against the financial
industry instead of through its customers. APTs are not only for stealing
information anymore.
