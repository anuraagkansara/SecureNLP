This O
is O
not O
a O
corporate O
slogan O
, O
and O
it O
is O
not O
a O
marketing O
theme O
. O
 
It O
is O
the O
realization O
of O
having O
the O
most O
dedicated O
professionals O
focusing O
on O
solving O
problems O
that O
have O
real O
strategic O

on O
our O

When O
we O
consider O
the O
problems O
facing O
our O
customers O
, O
we O
know O
that O
intelligence O
allows O
them O
to O
make O
key O
decisions O
that O
can O
mean O
the O
difference O
between O
disaster O
and O
triumph O
. O
 
In O
the O
earliest O
days O
building O
CrowdStrike O
, O
we O
drew O
heavily O
on O
the O
concepts O
encompassed O
in O
Colonel O
John O
Boyd O
's O
OODA O
loop O
( O
OODA O
is O
an O
acronym O
for O
Observe O
, O
Orient O
, O
Decide O
, O
Act O
) O
. O
 
It O
has O
been O
applied O
over O
the O
years O
to O
all O
manner O
of O
decision O
- O
making O
situations O
. O
 
The O
core O
of O
the O
OODA O
model O
is O
that O
a O
decision O
- O
making O
process O
is O
broken O
into O
phases O
, O
and O
in O
an O
adversarial O
encounter O
, O
two O
entities O
will O
go O
through O
the O
same O
process O
. O
 
Whichever O
entity O
goes O
through O
the O
process O
the O
fastest O
will O
likely O
prevail O
. O
 
The O
reason O
that O
intelligence O
powers O
everything O
we O
do O
is O
that O
we O
seek O
to O
provide O
our O
customers O
with O
the O
ability O
to O
come O
to O
a O
decision O
( O
the O
last O
step O
of O
the O
OODA O
loop O
) O
before O
the O
adversary O
does O
, O
thus O
ensuring O
a O
favorable O
outcome O
. O
 
In O
intelligence O
circles O
, O
this O
is O
often O
referred O
to O
as O
decision O
advantage O
, O
and O
when O
dealing O
with O
adversaries O
trying O
to O
compromise O
your O
enterprise O
security O
, O
you O
want O
it O
. O
 
Throughout O
2014 O
, O
the O
activity O
monitored O
by O
CrowdStrike O
in O
the O
cyber O
domain O
was O
reflective O
of O
the O
events O
unfolding O
in O
the O
real O
world O
. O
 
This O
was O
punctuated O
in O
late O
2014 O
with O
the O
now O
- O
infamous O
attack O
attributed O
to O
North O
Korean O
actors O
who O
levied O
destructive O
malware O
in O
a O
flagrant O
assault O
against O
a O
private O
entity O
. O
 
The O
actor O
in O
this O
case O
, O
which O
CrowdStrike O
has O
traced O
back O
to O
2006 O
, O
has O
a O
history O
of O
using O
destructive O
code O
against O
its O
targets O
. O
 
This O
actor O
again O
launched O
attacks O
in O
December O
against O
its O
usual O
adversary O
, O
the O
Republic O
of O
Korea O
. O
 
The O
highly O
publicized O
events O
that O
initially O
suppressed O
the O
release O
of O
a O
movie O
deemed O
offensive O
by O
the O
Democratic O
People O
's O
Republic O
of O
Korea O
resulted O
in O
unprecedented O
awareness O
of O
the O
power O
that O
one O
adversary O
can O
wield O
against O
a O
target O
if O
they O
are O
suitably O
motivated O
. O
 
This O

There O
are O
a O
few O
takeaways O
from O
this O

Vietnam O
and O
GOBLIN O
PANDA O
were O
respectively O
the O
most O
targeted O
country O
and O
the O
most O
active O

. O
 
From O
late O
spring O
through O
summer O
, O
GOBLIN O
PANDA O
conducted O
consistent O
targeted O

operations O
targeting O
organizations O
in O
Vietnam O
focused O
on O
tensions O
in O
the O
South O
China O

. O
 
These O
campaigns B-Entity
relied B-Action
primarily O
on B-Modifier
spear O

with I-Entity
malicious I-Entity
documents I-Entity
that I-Entity
dropped I-Entity

( I-Entity
mostly I-Entity
PlugX I-Entity
) I-Entity
along I-Entity
with I-Entity
Vietnamese- I-Entity
language I-Entity
decoy I-Entity
documents I-Entity
. O
 
The O
content O
of O
these O
decoys O
often O
came O
from O
documents O
produced O
by O
Vietnam O
's O
government O
, O
which O
indicates O
that O
the O
adversary O
possibly O
infiltrated O
the O
government O
's O
network O
and O
was O
using O
stolen O
documents O
in O
its O
operations O

The O

GOBLIN O
PANDA O

at O
Vietnam O
in O
general O
, O
tailed O
off O
in O
the O
final O
months O
of O
2014 O
, O
but O
the O
volume O
of O
activity O
in O
spring O
and O

was O
enough O
to O
push O
them O
to O
the O
top O

2014 O
PlugX O
was O
by O
far O
the O
most O
used O
malware O
variant O
for O
targeted O
activity O
during O
2014 O
. O
 
It O
proliferated O
greatly O
amongst O
China O
- O
based O
targeted O
intrusion O
adversaries O
and O
now O
appears O
to O
be O
the O
tool O
of O
choice O
for O
many O
. O
 
The O
malware O
has O
been O
around O
for O
years O
and O
has O
been O
used O
by O
multiple O
Chinese O
actors O
for O
quite O
some O
time O
; O
however O
, O
the O
frequency O
of O
PlugX O
use O
during O
2014 O
revealed O
just O
how O
prominent O
it O
is O
. O
 
PlugX O
is O
used O
by O
both O
more O
advanced O
China O

AURORA O
PANDA O
and O
adversaries O
of O
a O
lower O
level O
of O

such O
as O
GOBLIN O
PANDA O
. O
 
The O
reason O
for O
its O
prevalence O
is O
not O
clear O
. O
 
It O
is O
possible O
that O
there O
is O
a O
central O
malware O
dissemination O
channel O
supplying O
many O
Chinese O
adversaries O
and O
this O
is O
why O
so O
many O
groups O
are O
now O
using O
it O
. O
 
It O
is O
also O
possible O
that O

Gameover O

Gameover O
Zeus O
( O
GOZ O

was O
a O
complex O
P2P O
botnet O
that O
has O
been O
one O
of O
the O
most O
prevalent O
cyber O
threats O
for O
almost O
four O
years O
. O
 
It O
was O
forked O
off O

was O
leaked O
in O
spring O
2011 O
– O
just O
a O
few O
months O
before O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
first O
GOZ O
version O
. O
 
GOZ O
was O
largely O
used O
for O
banking O

and O
the O
delivery O
of O
other O

, O
such O
as O
the O
CryptoLocker O

, O
and O
is O
believed O
to O
have O
caused O
more O
than O
$ O
100 O
million O
in O
financial O

. O
 
The O
GOZ O
botnet O
was O
long O
believed O
to O
be O
resistant O
to O
any O
takedown O
attempts O
because O
of O
its O
complex O

: O
Infected O

The O

to O
announce O

In O
June O
2014 O
, O
the O

was O
disrupted O
by O
the O
taking O

and O
at O
the O

time O
preventing O

by O
the O

While O
this O
effort O
had O
to O
take O

, O
it O
was O
primarily O
focused O
on O
the O

By O
propagating O

in O
the O

, O
its O

The O

Had O
the O

successful O

Although O
the O

partly O
due O

the O

the O

a O
threat O
to O

The O

Though O

, O
the O
apparent O
effort O

through O
to O
down O
the O

substantial O

As O
the O

DerpTrolling O
The O

collective O
DerpTrolling O
made O
early O
2014 O

headlines O
Notable O
Activity O
after O
claiming O
a O
string O
of O
DDoS O
attacks O
on O
multiple O
gaming O
companies O
and O
online O
gaming O
servers O
. O
 
The O
group O
likely O
originated O
out O
of O
the O
Steam O
gaming O
community O
, O
where O
some O
of O
its O
suspected O

engaged O
in O
early O
DDoS O
attacks O
on O
rival O
gaming O

and O
their O

. O
 
DerpTrolling O

antics O
were O
often O
childish O
and O
had O
no O
clear O
motive O
other O
than O
being O
" O
for O
the O
lulz O
" O
and O
to O
boost O
their O
own O
egos O
. O
 
For O
this O
reason O
, O
they O
can O
not O
be O
classified O
as O
hacktivists O
. O
 
Despite O
their O
immaturity O
, O
the O
collective O
was O
able O
to O
consistently O
carry O
out O
DDoS O
attacks O
on O
targets O
of O
their O
choosing O
, O
and O
these O
attacks O
had O
a O
real O
- O
world O
effect O
on O
the O
victims O
within O
the O

. O
 
The O
attacks O
were O
particularly O
noteworthy O
as O
their O
DDoS O
tool O
, O
dubbed O
the O
Gaben O
Laser O

( O

after O
Gabe O
Newell O
, O
the O
creator O
of O
Half O

the O

, O
supposedly O
created O
an O
attack O
that O
exceeded O
400 O
gbps O
of O

utilizing O
a O
NTP O

This O
suggested O
DerpTrolling O
possessed O
an O
above O

While O
NTP O

commonly O
known O
in O
the O

community O
, O
most O
" O

skids O
" O
were O
not O
aware O
of O
some O
of O
these O
more O

which O
allows O
for O
fewer O

needed O
to O
pull O

larger O
DDoS O

. O
 
DerpTrolling O
has O
reportedly O
had O
several O
run O

ins O
with O
law O

, O
though O
it O
is O
unclear O
how O
much O
of O
this O
is O
verifiable O
versus O
a O
ploy O
to O
increase O
their O
notoriety O
. O
 
One O
supposed O

resulted O
in O
the O

going O
silent O
for O
several O
months O
before O
returning O
and O
carrying O
out O
lower O

attacks O
on O
the O

community O
once O
again O
. O
 
Given O
the O
collective O
's O
poor O
operational O
security O
practices O
, O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
the O
members O
are O
actively O
being O

by O

that O
they O
can O

their O

them O

LizardSquad O
has O
even O

It O
became O
a O

how O

Microsoft O

Execution O
In O

, O
CrowdStrike O

spent O
a O
significant O
amount O
of O
time O
investigating O
operations O
that O
leveraged O
the O
new O
Microsoft O
Word O
exploit O
, O
CVE-2014 O
- O
1761 O
. O
 
The O
exploit O
for O
this O
vulnerability O
was O
a O
bit O
complex O
, O
but O
if O
successful O
it O
allowed O
for O
remote O
code O
execution O
. O
 
Cybercrime O
adversaries O
were O
the O
first O
to O
use O
the O
exploit O
in O
the O
wild O
; O
however O
, O
its O
use O
soon O
proliferated O
to O
Russia- O
and O
China O
- O

. O
 
The O
proliferation O
of O
an O
exploit O
such O
as O
CVE-2014 O
- O
1761 O
across O
several O
adversaries O
is O
not O
unprecedented O
, O
but O
it O
does O
illustrate O
the O
possible O
ways O
in O
which O

In O
this O
instance O
, O
cybercrime O
actors O
were O
the O
first O
observed O
using O
the O

. O
 
Several O
weeks O
later O
targeted O

adversaries O
began O
leveraging O
it O
in O
their O
operations O
. O
 
The O
most O
likely O
explanation O
for O
this O
is O
that O
targeted O
intrusion O
adversaries O
were O
able O
to O
rediscover O
and O
develop O
the O
exploit O
code O
once O
a O
vendor O
advisory O
was O

. O
 
Notable O
Activity O
This O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
most O
likely O
because O
Microsoft O
released O
its O
initial O
advisory O
on O
the O
exploit O
in O
late O
March O
, O
and O
targeted O
activity O
began O
in O
early O
April O
. O
 
However O
, O
another O
possible O
proliferation O
pathway O
for O
the O
exploit O
is O
a O
direct O
pass O
from O
a O
cybercrime O
actor O
to O
a O
targeted O
intrusion O
actor O
. O
 
It O
is O
also O
possible O
that O
individuals O
involved O
in O
cybercrime O
operations O
are O
also O
carrying O
out O
targeted O
intrusion O
operations O
and O
were O
able O
to O
use O
the O
exploit O
for O
both O
purposes O
. O
 
CrowdStrike O
Intelligence O
also O
discovered O
a O
simple O

, O
which O
allowed O
malicious O

to O
automatically O
build O

One O
of O
the O
primary O
reasons O
for O
this O

is O
likely O
that O

have O
recently O
been O
growing O
stronger O
. O
 
In O
May O

that O
uses O

revealed O
that O
, O
up O
until O

from O
Asia O
- O

This O
shift O
coincided O
with O
a O
significant O
uptick O
in O

from O
the O
Islamic O

Syria O
( O

an O

on O
the O
Baiji O

At O
one O

the O

China O

. O
 
Additional O
targets O
at O
this O

an O

The O

information O
on O
high O

The O

these O
institutions O
focused O
on O
Asia O
issues O

how O

these O

are O

The O

a O
brief O
look O
back O
at O
the O

in O
order O
. O
 
Last O

CrowdStrike O
made O
a O
number O

many O
of O
which O

Outlook O
for O
China O
- O
Based O
Adversaries O
China O
is O
, O
by O
now O
, O
well O
known O
for O
conducting O
cyber O
espionage O
campaigns O
focused O
on O
accessing O
intelligence O
about O
intellectual O
property O
, O
mergers O
and O
acquisitions O
, O
and O
technologies O
highlighted O
in O
its O
Five O
- O
Year O
plans O
. O
 
Targeting O
these O
technologies O
and O
strategic O
business O
information O
allow O
its O
domestic O
companies O
to O
rapidly O
make O
" O
leap O
frog O
" O
developments O
, O
and O
to O
benefit O
from O
favorable O
bargaining O
positions O
, O
thus O
elevating O
them O
to O
become O
global O
leaders O
. O
 
This O
behavior O
is O
expected O
to O
continue O
in O
2015 O
, O
as O
will O
continued O
targeting O
of O
foreign O
government O
entities O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
access O
information O
related O
to O
the O
global O
strategy O
and O
plans O
of O
these O
countries O
. O
 
China O
is O
expected O
to O
continue O
to O
leverage O
this O
espionage O
as O
a O
means O
to O
conduct O
intelligence O
collection O
to O
support O
its O
aspirations O
to O
further O
push O
the O
envelope O
on O
its O
territorial O
claims O
. O
 
This O
is O
particularly O
true O
in O
the O
South O
China O
Sea O
( O
SCS O
) O
conflicts O
with O
Vietnam O
and O
the O
Philippines O
, O
and O
the O
Senkaku O
/ O
Diaoyu O
island O
dispute O
with O
Japan O
. O
 
China O
has O
already O
undertaken O
substantial O
construction O
of O
manmade O
islands O
in O
the O
SCS O
to O
begin O
projecting O
its O
power O
, O
and O
as O
its O
Navy O
continues O
to O
grow O
, O
it O
will O
only O
seek O
to O
push O
further O
beyond O
its O
current O
boundaries O
. O
 
China O
is O
aggressively O
moving O
forward O
with O
the O
design O
and O
implementation O
of O
its O
own O
aircraft O
carriers O
, O
which O
will O
no O
doubt O
have O
an O
impact O
in O
this O
regional O
issue O
, O
allowing O
the O
PRC O
to O
project O
force O
and O
intimidate O
its O
neighbors O
. O
 
Looking O
Forward O
Taiwan O
will O
continue O
to O
play O
a O
very O
important O
role O
in O
the O
potential O
conflicts O
to O
come O
, O
not O
only O
as O
a O
testing O
ground O
for O
malware O
, O
but O
as O
the O
main O
focus O
for O
expanding O
Chinese O
territorial O
claims O
. O
 
The O
PRC O
views O
Taiwan O
as O
an O
inalienable O
part O
of O
China O
that O
will O
eventually O
be O
reunited O
for O
the O
greater O
good O
of O
both O
peoples O
and O
therefore O
places O
it O
above O
other O
territorial O
conflicts O
. O
 
Taiwan O
's O
recent O
shift O
towards O
a O
decidedly O
less O
- O
Beijing O
- O
friendly O
, O
DPP O
- O
led O
government O
is O
of O
great O
concern O
to O
China O
and O
will O
be O
a O
major O
factor O
in O
how O
China O
uses O
technology O
to O
facilitate O
its O
political O
maneuverings O
. O
 
Taiwan O
has O
historically O
been O
penetrated O
by O
PRC O
intelligence O
services O
at O
all O
levels O
, O
which O
makes O
cyber O
one O
of O
the O
first O
visible O
indicators O
of O
PRC O
intentions O
regarding O
Taiwan O
. O
 
China O
has O
also O
made O
significant O
headway O
on O
projecting O
its O
" O
soft O
power O
" O
abroad O
via O
multiple O
billion O
- O
dollar O
investments O
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
sectors O
of O
communications O
and O
transportation O
infrastructure O
. O
 
For O
years O
, O
China O
has O
been O
making O
inroads O
in O
Africa O
to O
provide O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
the O
continent O
's O
telecommunication O
systems O
, O
but O
only O
recently O
have O
some O
of O
the O
more O
sinister O
intentions O
been O
brought O
to O
light O
. O
 
In O
December O
2014 O
, O
approximately O
77 O
Chinese O
nationals O
were O
found O
to O
be O
running O
a O
sophisticated O
command O
center O
out O
of O
a O
house O
in O
Nairobi O
, O
Kenya O
, O
which O
appeared O
to O

capable O
of O
targeting O
the O
main O

There O
has O
also O
been O
a O
significant O
amount O
of O
investment O
poured O
into O
transportation O
projects O
, O
particularly O
high O
- O
speed O
rail O
( O
HSR O
) O
lines O
, O
in O
multiple O
countries O
. O
 
China O
has O
already O
planned O
to O
merge O
its O
two O
top O
train O
makers O
into O
a O
HSR O
juggernaut O
capable O
of O
building O
massive O
rail O
lines O
around O
the O
world O
. O
 
To O
this O
end O
, O
China O
has O
submitted O
bids O
for O
massive O
rail O
projects O
in O
Nigeria O
, O
and O
nearly O
won O
( O
this O
was O
subsequently O
canceled O
) O
another O
project O
in O
Mexico O
. O
 
China O
has O
also O
suggested O
massive O
lines O
between O
Beijing O
and O
Moscow O
and O
constructing O
a O
line O
between O
Delhi O
and O
Chennai O
in O
India O
. O
 
Beijing O
also O
remains O
interested O
in O
proposals O
for O
HSRs O
in O
Britain O
and O
California O
, O
and O
has O
already O
made O
headway O
on O
construction O
of O
a O
Hungary- O
Serbian O
HSR O
that O
will O
connect O
Belgrade O
to O
Budapest O
. O
 
In O
total O
, O
the O
projects O
proposed O
by O
China O
would O
give O
it O
control O
of O
more O
than O
40,000 O
km O
, O
giving O
it O
significant O
control O
over O
the O
world O
's O
transportation O
routes O
. O
 
It O
seems O
fairly O
likely O
that O
, O
given O
China O
's O
previous O
use O
of O
espionage O
against O
foreign O
companies O
( O
which O
it O
has O
used O
to O
gain O
advantages O
in O
competitive O
bidding O
and O
mergers O
& O
acquisitions O
) O
, O
there O
is O
a O
substantial O
motivation O
for O
China O
to O
follow O
suit O
in O
the O
coming O
year O
as O
it O
looks O
to O
secure O
its O
position O

Joint O
Plan O

The O
Iranian O
Joint O
Plan O

( O
JPOA O
) O
, O
its O
delay O
, O
and O
its O
ultimate O
desired O
path O
by O
politicians O
to O
negotiate O
a O
Comprehensive O
Plan O
of O
Action O
( O
CPOA O
) O
are O
preeminent O
issues O
in O
the O
global O
press O
and O
political O
circles O
. O
 
The O
JPOA O
is O
a O
temporary O
agreement O
made O
between O
Iran O
and O
an O
intergovernmental O
negotiating O
body O
consisting O
of O
China O
, O
France O
, O
the O
Russian O
Federation O
, O
the O
Un O
ited O
Kingdom O
, O
the O
United O
States O
and O
Germany O
. O
 
The O
agreement O
was O
originally O
intended O
to O
be O
a O
six O
- O
month O
period O
in O
which O
the O
Iranian O
government O
would O
reduce O
its O
stockpile O
of O
enriched O
uranium O
fuel O
and O
suspend O
specific O
aspects O
of O
its O
nuclear O
energy O
programs O
in O
exchange O
for O
the O
UN O
Security O
Council O
relaxing O
of O
specific O
sanctions O
previously O
imposed O
against O
Iran O
. O
 
During O
this O
time O
of O
suspended O
nuclear O
research O
activities O
and O
Looking O
Forward O
eased O
sanctions O
, O
negotiating O
parties O
would O
discuss O
the O
details O
of O
a O
more O
permanent O
agreement O
, O
known O
as O
the O
Comprehensive O
Plan O
of O
Action O
( O
CPOA O
) O
. O
 
The O
JPOA O
could O
be O
a O
driver O
or O
tipping O
point O
for O
future O
cyber O
attacks O
by O
Iran O
against O
western O
targets O
. O
 
Iran O
has O
publicly O
noted O
the O
understanding O
that O
negotiations O
can O
be O
influenced O
and O
has O
demonstrated O
historically O
that O
it O
is O
willing O
( O
and O
has O
capabilities O
) O
to O
conduct O
cyber O
operations O
to O
influence O
negotiations O
if O
it O
sees O
fit O
to O
do O
so O
. O
 
It O
has O
been O
publicly O
speculated O
that O
Iran O
has O
conducted O
retaliatory O
attacks O
, O
notably O
the O
Shamoon O
incident O
in O
2012 O
. O
 
Recent O
open O
- O
source O
activities O
in O
the O
Iranian O
underground O
suggest O
Iran O
may O
be O
attempting O
to O
structure O
or O
resource O
for O
possible O
future O
cyber O
operations O
. O
 
There O
have O
been O
visibility O
changes O
with O
regard O
to O
information O
surrounding O
Iranian O
hackers O
, O
as O
well O
as O
forums O
and O
websites O
. O
 
Popular O
forums O
for O
Iranian O
hackers O
ISCN O
and O
Shabgard O
have O
been O
shut O
down O
and O
are O
no O
longer O
publicly O
accessible O
. O
 
Despite O
the O
shutdowns O
, O
there O
will O
likely O
be O
little O
change O
to O
the O
communication O
occurring O
between O
affiliated O
hackers O
in O
closed O
communications O
pathways O
. O
 
The O
closing O
of O
these O
forums O
could O
be O
in O
anticipation O
of O
future O
malicious O
activity O
and O
a O
desire O
to O
decrease O
the O
public O
profile O
of O
individuals O
in O
the O
Iranian O
underground O
. O
 
There O
are O
also O
clear O
links O
between O
the O
Iranian O
government O
hacking O
contests O
intended O
to O
identify O
hackers O
with O
advanced O
skills O
and O
to O
learn O
advanced O
methods O
of O
network O
intrusion O
. O
 
For O
example O
, O
in O
November O
2013 O
, O
just O
before O
the O
JPOA O
agreement O
was O
signed O
, O
Sharif O
University O
of O
Technology O
conducted O
a O
contest O
for O
" O
innovative O
methods O
" O
of O
computer O
network O
intrusions O
and O
defense O
against O
such O
intrusions O
. O
 
Based O
on O
the O
contest O
announcements O
, O
Iranian O
government O
cyber O
security O
authorities O
had O
access O
to O
the O
students O
' O
submissions O
in O
the O
contest O
, O
and O
those O
submissions O
were O
not O
released O
to O
the O
public O
but O
rather O
kept O
private O
to O
only O
those O
with O
access O
to O
the O
contest O
submissions O
. O
 
Looking O
Forward O
Iranian O
adversaries O
such O
as O
ROCKET O
KITTEN O
, O
FLYING O
KITTEN O
, O
and O
CHARMING O
KITTEN O
were O
quite O
active O
during O
2014 O
targeting O
western O
governments O
and O
companies O
. O
 
The O
motivation O
to O
attack O
such O
targets O
will O
only O
increase O
during O
2015 O
. O
 
However O
, O
should O
the O
process O
around O
the O
JPOA O
and O
CPOA O
take O
a O
turn O
that O
Iran O
perceives O
as O
disadvantageous O
, O
the O
motivation O
will O
likely O
greatly O
increase O
. O
 
Recent O
revelations O
indicate O
that O
ROCKET O
KITTEN O
may O
have O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
targeted O
the O
JPOA O
negotiations O
using O
spear O
phishing O
that O
may O
have O
targeted O
diplomats O
involved O
in O
the O
meetings O
. O
 
Cyber O
Spillover O
from O
Regional O
Conflicts O
Last O
year O
's O
report O
included O
cyber O
spillover O
as O
something O
to O
look O
for O
in O
2014 O
, O
and O
it O
will O
be O
equally O
as O
important O
in O
2015 O
. O
 
Increasingly O
, O
real- O
world O
physical O
conflicts O
are O
carrying O
with O
them O
associated O
cyber O
components O
. O
 
Sometimes O
the O
related O
cyber O
operations O
are O
carried O
out O
by O
entities O
directly O
engaged O
in O
the O
conflict O
, O
and O
other O
times O
entities O
not O
directly O
involved O
will O
engage O
in O
cyber O
operations O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
support O
one O
side O
or O
the O
other O
. O
 
It O
is O
not O
possible O
to O
predict O
all O
possible O
conflicts O
in O
2015 O
, O
but O
there O
are O
three O
primary O
areas O
to O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
. O
 
The O
conflict O
that O
may O
see O
the O
most O
significant O
uptick O
in O
associated O
activity O
is O
the O
one O
centered O
around O
ISIS O
. O
 
The O
Syrian O
civil O
war O
saw O
quite O
a O
bit O
of O
associated O
cyber O
operations O
against O
western O
targets O
in O
2013 O
, O
many O
of O
which O
were O
attributed O
to O
the O
DEADEYE O
JACKAL O
adversary O
( O
Syrian O
Electronic O
Army O
) O
. O
 
Since O
that O
time O
, O
the O
ISIS O
terrorist O
group O
has O
become O
a O
significant O
threat O
in O
the O
region O
and O
appears O
to O
be O
capable O
of O
bringing O
resources O
to O
bear O
to O
carry O
out O
malicious O
cyber O
attacks O
. O
 
Already O
, O
in O
early O
January O
2015 O
, O
a O
group O
calling O
itself O
CyberCaliphate O
and O
declaring O
support O
for O
ISIS O
hacked O
the O
social O
media O
presence O
of O
U.S. O
 
Central O
Command O
and O
used O
it O
to O
spread O
Islamist O
propaganda O
. O
 
It O
is O
likely O
that O
this O
and O
other O
related O
groups O
supporting O
the O
Islamist O
cause O
will O
engage O
in O
operations O
that O
support O
ISIS O
objectives O
. O
 
Most O
of O
this O
activity O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
a O
nuisance O
, O
such O
as O
defacements O
and O
Looking O
Forward O
low O
- O
level O
DDOS O
attacks O
, O
but O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
more O
advanced O
actors O
could O
carry O
out O
targeted O
or O
even O
destructive O
attacks O
. O
 
The O
South O
China O
Sea O
will O
be O
an O
area O
to O
continue O
to O
watch O
in O
2015 O
. O
 
As O
discussed O
above O
, O
tensions O
in O
this O
area O
drove O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
targeted O
intrusion O
activity O
from O
China O
- O
based O
adversaries O
in O
2014 O
. O
 
Tensions O
subsided O
toward O
the O
end O
of O
2014 O
, O
but O
the O
region O
is O
rich O
in O
natural O
resources O
and O
countries O
there O
, O
particularly O
China O
, O
are O
eager O
to O
lay O
claim O
to O
those O
resources O
. O
 
Because O
of O
this O
, O
there O
is O
a O
significant O
possibility O
that O
the O
conflict O
will O
flare O
up O
again O
in O
the O
coming O
year O
. O
 
One O
thing O
that O
could O
temper O
the O
possibility O
for O
conflict O
is O
if O
oil O
prices O
remain O
low O
, O
making O
oil O
exploration O
in O
the O
area O
potentially O
less O
lucrative O
. O
 
Ukraine O
is O
the O
third O
region O
to O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
for O
possible O
cyber O
spillover O
in O
2015 O
. O
 
The O
physical O
conflict O
there O
already O
spilled O
over O
into O
cyberspace O
, O
as O
was O
discussed O
above O
. O
 
So O
long O
as O
the O
Ukrainian O
conflict O
remains O
unresolved O
and O
foreign O
governments O
continue O
to O
exert O
pressure O
on O
Russia O
via O
economic O
sanctions O
, O
expect O
continued O
Russian O
targeting O
of O
governments O
, O
particularly O
those O
in O
Europe O
and O
the O
U.S. O
 
Another O
related O
contributing O
factor O
to O
Russian O
cyber O
operations O
is O
the O
falling O
price O
of O
oil O
. O
 
Russia O
's O
economy O
is O
deeply O
dependent O
on O
oil O
prices O
. O
 
The O
precipitous O
fall O
in O
the O
price O
of O
oil O
at O
the O
end O
of O
2014 O
and O
going O
into O
2015 O
has O
already O
caused O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
economic O
turmoil O
in O
Russia O
. O
 
An O
extended O
period O
of O
low O
oil O
prices O
could O
result O
in O
increased O
malicious O
cyber O
activity O
from O
Russian O
adversaries O
against O
foreign O
governments O
and O
private O
sector O
organizations O
. O
 
The O
Future O
for O
PoS O
Attacks O
PoS O
malware O
experienced O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
success O
during O
2014 O
, O
however O
upcoming O
changes O
may O
force O
changes O
in O
payment- O
processing O
systems O
in O
the O
U.S. O
 
For O
example O
, O
several O
major O
credit O
card O
companies O
are O
expected O
to O
institute O
new O
policies O
in O
October O
2015 O
that O
will O
shift O
liability O
for O
fraudulent O
transactions O
to O
whomever O
Looking O
Forward O
is O
using O
the O
weakest O
payment O
- O
processing O
systems O
. O
 
The O
purpose O
of O
this O
is O
to O
drive O
retailers O
to O
adopt O
EMV O
( O
Europay O
, O
MasterCard O
, O
and O
Visa O
) O
standards O
, O
which O
entail O
chip O
and O
PIN O
cards O
that O
use O
a O
combination O
of O
the O
traditional O
PIN O
number O
and O
an O
embedded O
microchip O
that O
encrypts O
vital O
information O
. O
 
This O
type O
of O
card O
offers O
a O
more O
secure O
payment O
card O
solution O
for O
consumers O
. O
 
Additionally O
, O
several O
alternative O
solutions O
, O
such O
as O
Apple O
Pay O
and O
Google O
Wallet O
, O
have O
started O
becoming O
adopted O
, O
allowing O
for O
payment O
via O
token O
systems O
. O
 
In O
theses O
systems O
, O
rather O
than O
a O
card O
number O
being O
transmitted O
, O
a O
one O
- O
time O
token O
is O
passed O
from O
a O
consumer O
's O
device O
to O
the O
retailer O
. O
 
The O
advantage O
to O
this O
system O
is O
that O
in O
the O
event O
of O
the O
token O
being O
obtained O
by O
an O
unauthorized O
party O
, O
it O
can O
not O
be O
reused O
for O
later O
transactions O
. O
 
Adoption O
of O
these O
newer O
payment O
processes O
should O
provide O
consumers O
with O
more O
secure O
payment O
methods O
and O
make O
it O
more O
difficult O
for O
criminals O
seeking O
to O
make O
money O
off O
these O
systems O
. O
 
There O
will O
be O
some O
lag O
time O
in O
2015 O
as O
retailers O
and O
banks O
move O
to O
put O
these O
improvements O
in O
place O
, O
during O
which O
cybercriminals O
will O
still O
be O
able O
to O
exploit O
the O
current O
, O
antiquated O
payment O
processing O
systems O
in O
the O
U.S. O
 
However O
, O
the O
newer O
processes O
, O
once O
in O
place O
, O
should O
lead O
to O
a O
decline O
in O
the O
type O
of O
PoS O
attacks O
seen O
over O
the O
past O
year O
. O
 
Despite O
this O
decline O
, O
it O
is O
almost O
certain O
that O
the O
implementation O
of O
more O
secure O
methods O
will O
lead O
cybercriminals O
to O
develop O
more O
sophisticated O
means O
by O
which O
to O
attack O
payment- O
processing O
systems O
. O
 
Destructive O
and O
Disruptive O
Attacks O
Destructive O
attacks O
( O
such O
as O
those O
carried O
out O
by O
SILENT O
CHOLLIMA O
) O
and O
disruptive O
attacks O
( O
such O
as O
the O
DDOS O
activity O
against O
gaming O
platforms O
) O
garnered O
headlines O
at O
the O
end O
of O
2014 O
. O
 
The O
high O
- O
profile O
nature O
of O
these O
attacks O
does O
not O
necessarily O
indicate O
that O
they O
will O
grow O
in O
popularity O
in O
2015 O
, O
however O
it O
is O
Looking O
Forward O
possible O
that O
the O
success O
of O
these O
attacks O
may O
encourage O
other O
groups O
to O
engage O
in O
destructive O
or O
disruptive O
operations O
to O
advance O
their O
interests O
. O
 
As O
an O
example O
of O
this O
, O
a O
series O
of O
disruptive O
attacks O
in O
December O
targeted O
online O
gaming O
platforms O
. O
 
These O
attacks O
manifested O
in O
the O
form O
of O
DDOS O
operations O
carried O
out O
by O
the O
LizardSquad O
group O
briefly O
discussed O
above O
. O
 
The O
attacks O
came O
in O
two O
waves O
, O
the O
first O
of O
which O
was O
in O
early O
December O
when O
the O
Xbox O
Live O
and O
PlayStation O
networks O
were O
knocked O
offline O
for O
a O
short O
period O
of O
time O
. O
 
The O
second O
wave O
of O
attacks O
occurred O
on O
25 O
December O
2014 O
when O
the O
Xbox O
and O
PlayStation O
online O
platforms O
suffered O
more O
outages O
that O
LizardSquad O
claimed O
responsibility O
for O
. O
 
CrowdStrike O
Intelligence O
is O
also O
aware O
of O
DDOS O
threats O
against O
other O
gaming O
platforms O
including O
Valve O
Software O
, O
which O
appeared O
to O
be O
targeted O
by O
a O
DNS O
amplification O
DDOS O
attack O
that O
is O
similar O
to O
previous O
LizardSquad O
activity O
. O
 
Malicious O
actors O
have O
already O
engaged O
in O
disruptive O
campaigns O
in O
early O
2015 O
. O
 
Following O
the O
January O
terrorist O
attacks O
in O
France O
, O
a O
group O
of O
Islamist O
hackers O
known O
as O
Fallaga O
conducted O
DDOS O
attacks O
against O
servers O
hosting O
websites O
for O
French O
foreign O
embassies O
. O
 
Soon O
after O
, O
another O
Islamist O
group O
identifying O
with O
ISIS O
took O
control O
of O
the O
Twitter O
and O
YouTube O
accounts O
for O
U.S. O
 
Central O
Command O
and O
posted O
a O
number O
of O
messages O
threatening O
U.S. O
 
troops O
and O
their O
families O
. O
 
Organizations O
in O
all O
sectors O
should O
be O
aware O
of O
, O
and O
prepared O
for O
, O
destructive O
and O
disruptive O
attacks O
. O
 
These O
operations O
are O
often O
motivated O
by O
a O
specific O
grievance O
, O
but O
sometimes O
no O
clear O
motivation O
can O
be O
established O
. O
 
Continuous O
monitoring O
for O
publicized O
threats O
against O
an O
organization O
, O
or O
for O
potential O
areas O
of O
controversy O
that O
could O
motivate O
malicious O
activity O
, O
is O
vital O
to O
detect O
and O
prepare O
for O
these O
types O
of O
attacks O
. O
 
The O
question O
now O
is O
: O
How O
do O
you O
incorporate O
intelligence O
into O
your O
daily O
defenses O
and O
prioritize O
resources O
based O
on O
risk O
to O
your O
business O
? O
Conclusion O
In O
the O
course O
of O
reviewing O
2014 O
, O
there O
were O
so O
many O
interesting O
events O
, O
adversaries O
, O
and O
innovations O
that O
selecting O
examples O
for O
this O
report O
was O
an O
incredible O
challenge O
. O
 
The O
CrowdStrike O
Intelligence O
team O
spent O
much O
time O
narrowing O
the O
scope O
of O
topics O
covered O
herein O
. O
 
The O
adversaries O
in O
2014 O
proved O
, O
if O
nothing O
else O
, O
to O
be O
dynamic O
, O
persistent O
, O
and O
innovative O
. O
 
Defenders O
must O
be O
inventive O
, O
diligent O
, O
and O
decisive O
in O
their O
efforts O
to O
defend O
the O
enterprise O
from O
these O
attackers O
. O
 
2015 O
will O
be O
a O
continuation O
of O
the O
cat O
- O
and O
- O
mouse O
game O
that O
is O
played O
between O
the O
adversary O
and O
the O
defender O
. O
 
Adversaries O
across O
the O
motivational O
spectrum O
will O
continue O
to O
evolve O
their O
tactics O
in O
order O
to O
achieve O
their O
objectives O
. O
 
Although O
tactics O
may O
evolve O
, O
network O
defenders O
will O
be O
able O
to O
have O
success O
against O
the O
adversary O
so O
long O
as O
they O
are O
well O
prepared O
. O
 
Intelligence O
will O
provide O
the O
decisive O
advantage O
to O
both O
sides O
, O
and O
having O
a O
good O
defense O
will O
be O
predicated O
on O
having O
an O
informed O
, O
intelligent O
defensive O
team O
. O
 
The O
incorporation O
of O
intelligence O
into O
the O
daily O
defense O
of O
the O
enterprise O
will O
continue O
to O
be O
paramount O
and O
products O
, O
services O
, O
and O
solution O
providers O
will O
need O
to O
use O
this O
intelligence O
to O
stay O
ahead O
of O
the O
adversary O
