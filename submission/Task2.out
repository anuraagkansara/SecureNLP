We	O

that	O
the	O

these	O

We	O

to	O
have	O
an	O
even	O
closer	O
look	O
at	O
Agent	O

BTZ	O
and	O
ComRAT	O
and	O
therefore	O
analyzed	O
the	O
evolution	O
of	O
this	O

covering	O
seven	O

Thanks	O
to	O
the	O

to	O
make	O
the	O

more	O
complex	O

We	O
can	O
see	O
that	O
this	O
malware	O
was	O
really	O
active	O
in	O
2007	O
and	O
2008	O
.	O

New	O
versions	O
declined	O
in	O
frequency	O
in	O
2009	O
and	O
only	O
one	O
new	O
sample	O
was	O
identified	O
in	O
2010	O

We	O
did	O
not	O
encounter	O
any	O
new	O
sample	O
from	O
2011	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
malware	O
appeared	O
back	O
in	O
2012	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
new	O
major	O
version	O
.	O

To	O
describe	O
the	O
evolution	O
of	O
the	O

,	O
we	O
decided	O
to	O
compare	O

to	O
institute	O

The	O
purpose	O

The	O
advantage	O
to	O

that	O

Adoption	O
of	O
these	O
newer	O
payment	O

should	O
provide	O
consumers	O
with	O
more	O

methods	O
and	O
make	O

difficult	O
for	O

off	O
these	O

There	O
will	O
be	O
some	O
lag	O
time	O
in	O
2015	O
as	O

move	O
to	O
put	O
these	O
improvements	O
in	O
place	O

during	O
which	O

to	O
exploit	O
the	O
current	O

However	O

the	O
