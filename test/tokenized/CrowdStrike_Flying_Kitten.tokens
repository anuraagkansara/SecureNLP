Today O
, O
our O
friends O
at O
FireEye O
released O
a O
report O
on O
an O
Iran O
- O
based O
adversary O
they O
are O
calling O
Saffron O
Rose O
. O

CrowdStrike O
Intelligence O
has O
also O
been O
tracking O
and O
reporting O
internally O
on O
this O
threat O
group O
since O
mid- O
January O
2014 O
under O
the O
name O
FLYING O
KITTEN O
, O
and O
since O
that O
time O
has O
seen O
targeting O
of O
multiple O
U.S.- O
based O
defense O
contractors O
as O
well O
as O
political O
dissidents O
. O

FireEye O
's O
report O
notes O
that O
this O
adversary O
's O
targeted O
intrusion O
activity O
consists O
of O
credential O
theft O
and O
malware O
delivery O
individually O
. O

The O
FLYING O
KITTEN O
campaigns O
investigated O
by O
CrowdStrike O
Intelligence O
showed O
that O
the O
actor O
actually O
combines O
the O
two O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the B-Entity
adversary I-Entity
will O
register O
a O
domain O
that O
spoofs B-Action
the O
name B-Entity
of I-Entity
the I-Entity
targeted I-Entity
organization I-Entity
and O
then O
host B-Action
a O
spoofed B-Entity
login I-Entity
page I-Entity
on I-Entity
that I-Entity
site I-Entity
. O

The O
page B-Entity
is O
used O
to O
steal B-Action
legitimate O
credentials B-Entity
, O
but O
once O
users B-Entity
enter O
the O
credentials O
, O
they O
are O
often O
redirected O
to O
a O
new O
page O
that O
prompts O
them O
to O
download B-Action
a O
" B-Entity
Browser I-Entity
Patch I-Entity
" I-Entity
or I-Entity
other I-Entity
similar I-Entity
type I-Entity
of I-Entity
file I-Entity
. O

The O
downloaded O
file O
is O
actually O
the B-Entity
Stealer I-Entity
malware I-Entity
that O
exfiltrates B-Action
stolen O
data B-Entity
to O
an O
FTP O
server O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
aerospace O
/ O
defense O
and O
dissident O
targeting O
, O
it O
also O
appears O
that O
FLYING O
KITTEN O
is O
also O
engaged O
in O
broader O
targeting O
via O
the O
website O
parmanpower[.]com O
. O

This O
website O
is O
registered O
via O
the O
same O
registrant O
email O
( O
info[@]usa.gov.us O
) O
and O
other O
Whois O
information O
as O
some O
of O
the O
other O
domains O
related O
to O
the O
activity O
discussed O
above O
. O

It O
purports O
to O
be O
the O
website O
of O
a O
business O
engaged O
in O
recruiting O
, O
training O
, O
and O
development O
in O
Erbil O
, O
Iraq O
. O

No O
malicious O
activity O
has O
been O
linked O
to O
this O
domain O
, O
however O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
was O
registered O
under O
the O
same O
registrant O
email O
at O
the O
same O
time O
as O
other O
FLYING O
KITTEN O
domains O
linked O
to O
malicious O
activity O
, O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
the O
adversary O
is O
using O
this O
site O
for O
malicious O
purposes O
as O
well O
. O

The O
website O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
deliver O
any O
malware O
, O
so O
its O
most O
likely O
purpose O
is O
to O
act O
as O
a O
credential O
- O
collection O
mechanism O
much O
like O
the O
spoofed O
Institute O
of O
Electrical O
and O
Electronics O
Engineers O
( O
IEEE O
) O
Aerospace O
Conference O
website O
( O
aeroconf2014[.]org O
) O
the O
adversary O
used O
earlier O
this O
year O
. O

This O
spoofed O
recruiting O
company O
website O
could O
be O
used O
to O
target O
entities O
across O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
sectors O
. O

Attribution O
in O
this O
case O
is O
interesting O
, O
as O
the O
adversary O
appears O
to O
have O
made O
a O
mistake O
when O
registering O
its O
malicious O
domains O
. O

The O
registrant O
email O
that O
currently O
appears O
in O
the O
Whois O
records O
of O
some O
of O
the O
FLYING O
KITTEN O
domains O
is O
info[@]usa.gov.us O
, O
however O
historical O
records O
show O
that O
the O
domains O
were O
originally O
registered O
under O
the O
email O
address O
keyvan.ajaxtm[@]gmail.com O
. O

As O
FireEye O
's O
report O
notes O
, O
the O
keyvan.ajaxtm@gmail.com O
email O
address O
ties O
back O
to O
an O
Iran O
- O
based O
entity O
called O
Ajax O
Security O
Team O
. O

Earlier O
this O
year O
, O
Ajax O
Security O
had O
an O
easily O
identifiable O
presence O
on O
the O
Internet O
with O
its O
own O
website O
and O
related O
Facebook O
pages O
. O

This O
Internet O
presence O
has O
decreased O
significantly O
since O
early O
2014 O
, O
likely O
due O
to O
a O
desire O
to O
keep O
a O
lower O
profile O
now O
that O
the O
group O
is O
engaged O
in O
targeted O
intrusion O
activity O
. O

The O
following O
Yara O
rules O
will O
provide O
detection O
for O
the O
adversary O
remote O
access O
toolkit O
and O
exfiltration O
tool O
. O

You O
can O
use O
this O
rule O
with O
CrowdStrike O
's O
free O
CrowdResponse O
tool O
to O
easily O
scan O
your O
systems O
for O
presence O
of O
FLYING O
KITTEN O
