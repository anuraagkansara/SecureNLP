On O

a O

Further O
investigation O
revealed O
similar O
activity O
stretching O
back O
to O
at O

April O
2014 O
, O
when O
similar O
TTPs O
were O
used O
to O
target O
a O

a O
U.S O

IT O

Two O
other O
incidents O
were O
also O
identified O
in O
August O
2014 O
targeting O
a O
company O
in O
the O
DIB O
and O
a O
Mongolian O
government O
entity O
. O

All O
incidents O
in O
this O
campaign O
were O
similar O
in O
that O
they O
utilized O
malicious O
droppers B-Entity
masquerading B-Action
as B-Modifier
installers B-Entity
for O
legitimate O
software O
applications O
like O
Adobe O
Reader O
, O
Juniper O
VPN O
, O
and O
Microsoft O
ActiveX O
Control O
. O

They O
display O
progress O
bars O
that O
make O
it O
appear O
as O
if O
the O
specified O
software O
is O
being O
updated O
or O
installed O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the B-Entity
droppers I-Entity
all O
directed B-Action
victims B-Entity
to B-Modifier
login O
pages B-Entity
for I-Entity
services I-Entity
specific I-Entity
to I-Entity
the I-Entity
target I-Entity
organization I-Entity
like I-Entity
webmail I-Entity
, I-Entity
document I-Entity
sharing I-Entity
, I-Entity
or I-Entity
corporate I-Entity
VPN I-Entity
. O

In O
all O
cases O
except O
one O
, O
the O
victims B-Entity
were O
directed B-Action
to B-Modifier
legitimate O
login B-Entity
pages I-Entity
. O

The O
one O
exception O
was O
a O
case O
in O
which O
victims B-Entity
were O
sent B-Action
to B-Modifier
a O
login B-Entity
page I-Entity
hosted I-Entity
on I-Entity
a I-Entity
domain I-Entity
that I-Entity
spoofed I-Entity
that I-Entity
of I-Entity
the I-Entity
legitimate I-Entity
one I-Entity
. O

It O
is O
unclear O
whether O
redirecting B-Action
victims B-Entity
to B-Modifier
these O
login B-Entity
pages I-Entity
was O
part O
of O
credential O
- O
collection O
activity O
or O
merely O
meant O
to O
deceive O
victims O
into O
believing O
that O
the O
activity O
was O
legitimate O
. O

The O
campaign O
appeared O
to O
be O
over O
by O
the O
end O
of O
August O
, O
but O
a O

was O
