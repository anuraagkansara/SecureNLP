The O

the O

publicly O

" O
FireEye O

Since O
the O

This O
is O
the O

has O
discovered O

retooling O

As O
such O
, O
FireEye O
believes O
this O
to O
be O
a O
common O
theme O
for O
this O
APT O
group O
, O
as O
APT12 O
will O
continue O
to O

in O
an O
effort O
to O
avoid O

continue O
its O
cyber O

. O
 
FireEye O
researchers O
also O
discovered O
two O
possibly O

utilizing O
two O

known O
as O

These O

While O
APT12 O

it O
is O

the O

Similarly O
, O
WATERSPOUT O

However O
, O
the O
WATERSPOUT O

shared O
several O
traits O
with O
the O
RIPTIDE O

HIGHTIDE O
campaign O
that O
we O
have O
attributed O
to O
APT12 O
. O
 
From O
October O

, O
FireEye O
observed O

In O
