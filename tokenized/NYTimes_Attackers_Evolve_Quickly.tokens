The O
attackers O
behind O
the O
breach O
of O
the O
New O
York O
Times O
' O
computer O
network O
late O
last O
year O
appear O
to O
be O
mounting O
fresh O
assaults O
that O
leverage O
new O
and O
improved O
versions O
of O
malware O
. O
 
The O
new O
campaigns O
mark O
the O
first O
significant O
stirrings O
from O
the O
group O
since O
it O
went O
silent O
in O
January O
in O
the O
wake O
of O
a O
detailed O
expose O
of O
the O
group O
and O
its O
exploits O
- O
and O
a O
retooling O
of O
what O
security O
researchers O
believe O
is O
a O
massive O
spying O
operation O
based O
in O
China O
. O
 
The O
newest O
campaign O
uses O
updated O
versions O
of O
Aumlib O
and O
Ixeshe O
. O
 
Aumlib B-Entity
, O
which O
for O
years O
has O
been O
used O
in O
targeted O
attacks O
, O
now O
encodes B-Action
certain B-Entity
HTTP I-Entity
communications I-Entity
. O
 
FireEye O
researchers O
spotted O
the O
malware O
when O
analyzing O
a O
recent O
attempted O
attack O
on O
an O
organization O
involved O
in O
shaping O
economic O
policy O
. O
 
And O
a B-Entity
new I-Entity
version I-Entity
of I-Entity
Ixeshe I-Entity
, O
which O
has O
been O
in O
service O
since O
2009 O
to O
attack O
targets O
in O
East O
Asia O
, O
uses B-Action
new B-Entity
network I-Entity
traffic I-Entity
patterns I-Entity
, O
possibly O
to B-Modifier
evade B-Entity
traditional I-Entity
network I-Entity
security I-Entity
systems I-Entity
. O
 
The O
updates O
are O
significant O
for O
both O
of O
the O
longstanding O
malware O
families O
; O
before O
this O
year O
, O
Aumlib O
had O
not O
changed O
since O
at O
least O
May O
2011 O
, O
and O
Ixeshe O
had O
not O
evolved O
since O
at O
least O
December O
2011 O
. O
 
Cybercriminals O
are O
constantly O
evolving O
and O
adapting O
in O
their O
attempts O
to O
bypass O
computer O
network O
defenses O
. O
 
But O
, O
larger O
, O
more O
successful O
threat O
actors O
tend O
to O
evolve O
at O
a O
slower O
rate O
. O
 
As O
long O
as O
these O
actors O
regularly O
achieve O
their O
objective O
( O
stealing O
sensitive O
data O
) O
, O
they O
are O
not O
motivated O
to O
update O
or O
rethink O
their O
techniques O
, O
tactics O
, O
or O
procedures O
( O
TTPs O
) O
. O
 
These O
threat O
actors O
' O
tactics O
follow O
the O
same O
principles O
of O
evolution O
â€“ O
successful O
techniques O
propagate O
, O
and O
unsuccessful O
ones O
are O
abandoned O
. O
 
Attackers O
do O
not O
change O
their O
approach O
unless O
an O
external O
force O
or O
environmental O
shift O
compels O
them O
to O
. O
 
As O
the O
old O
saying O
goes O
: O
If O
it O
ai O
n't O
broke O
, O
do O
n't O
fix O
it O
. O
 
So O
when O
a O
larger O
, O
successful O
threat O
actor O
changes O
up O
tactics O
, O
the O
move O
always O
piques O
our O
attention O
. O
 
Naturally O
, O
our O
first O
priority O
is O
ensuring O
that O
we O
detect O
the O
new O
or O
altered O
TTPs O
. O
 
But O
we O
also O
attempt O
to O
figure O
out O
why O
the O
adversary O
changed O
- O
what O
broke O
? O
- O
so O
that O
we O
can O
predict O
if O
and O
when O
they O
will O
change O
again O
in O
the O
future O
. O
 
We O
observed O
an O
example O
of O
this O
phenomenon O
around O
May O
. O
 
About O
four O
months O
after O
The O
New O
York O
Times O
publicized O
an O
attack O
on O
its O
network O
, O
the B-Entity
attackers I-Entity
behind I-Entity
the I-Entity
intrusion I-Entity
deployed B-Action
updated B-Entity
versions I-Entity
of I-Entity
their I-Entity
Backdoor.APT.Aumlib I-Entity
and I-Entity
Backdoor.APT.Ixeshe I-Entity

families I-Entity
. O
 
The O
previous O
versions O
of O
Aumlib O
had O
not O
changed O
since O
at O
least O
May O
2011 O
, O
and O
Ixeshe O
had O
not O
evolved O
since O
at O
least O
December O
2011 O
. O
 
We O
can O
not O
say O
for O
sure O
whether O
the O
attackers O
were O
responding O
to O
the O
scrutiny O
they O
received O
in O
the O
wake O
of O
the O
episode O
. O
 
But O
we O
do O
know O
the O
change O
was O
sudden O
. O
 
Akin O
to O
turning O
a O
battleship O
, O
retooling O
TTPs O
of O
large O
threat O
actors O
is O
formidable O
. O
 
Such O
a O
move O
requires O
recoding O
malware O
, O
updating O
infrastructure O
, O
and O
possibly O
retraining O
workers O
on O
new O
processes O
. O
 
The O
