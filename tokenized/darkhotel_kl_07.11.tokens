they B-Entity

. O
 
This O
first O
stage O
of O
malware O
helps O
the B-Entity

to O
identify B-Action
more B-Entity
significant I-Entity
victims I-Entity
, O
leading O

the O

At O
the O

these B-Entity

This O

know O
in O
advance O
when O
these O
individuals O
will O
arrive O
and O
depart O
from O
their O
high-end O

So O
, O
the O
attackers O
lay O
in O
wait O
until O
these O
travelers O
arrive O

connect O

that O
the O

effective O
toolset O
and O
a O
long-running O
operation O
behind O
the O

The O
Darkhotel O
APT O

precise O
malware O
spread O
was O
observed O
in O
several O
hotels' O
networks O
, O
where O
visitors B-Entity
connecting I-Entity

the I-Entity

prompted I-Action

Of O

, O
these B-Entity

Darkhotel I-Entity

were B-Action
installed I-Action
alongside B-Modifier
the B-Entity
legitimate I-Entity

. O
 
The O
most O
interesting O
thing O
about O
this O
delivery O
method O
is O
that O
the O
hotels O
require O
guests O
to O
use O
their O
last O

, O
yet O
only B-Entity
a I-Entity

When O

our O

This O
data O
is O
inconclusive O
, O
but O
it O
points O
to O
misuse O
of O
check-in O
information O
. O
 
The O
Darkhotel O
actor O
maintained O
an O
effective O
intrusion O
set O
at O
hotel O
networks O
, O
providing O
ample O
access O
to O
unexpected O
points O
of O

over O
several O
years O

These O

also O
provide O
the O

with O
access O
to O
check-in/check-out O

identity O
information O
of O

to O
high-end O
and O
luxury O
hotels O
. O
 
As O
a O
part O
of O
an O
ongoing O
investigation O
, O
our O
research O
led O
us O
to O
embedded B-Entity
iframes I-Entity
within I-Entity
hotel I-Entity

that O
redirected B-Action
individuals B-Entity
' I-Entity
web I-Entity
browsers I-Entity
to B-Modifier
phony B-Entity
install- I-Entity
ers I-Entity
. O
 
The O
attackers O
were O
very O
careful O
with O
the O
placement O
of O
these O
iframes O
and O
executables O
on O
trusted O
resources O
- O
the O
hotels O
' O
network O
login O
portals O
themselves O
. O
 
The B-Entity
attackers I-Entity
were O
also O
very O
careful O
to O
immediately O
delete B-Action
all B-Entity
traces I-Entity
of I-Entity
their I-Entity
tools I-Entity
as B-Modifier
soon I-Modifier
as I-Modifier
an B-Entity
attack I-Entity
was I-Entity
carried I-Entity
out I-Entity
successfully I-Entity
. O
 
Those O
portals O
are O
now O
reviewed O
, O
cleaned O
and O
undergoing O
a O
further O
review O
and O
hardening O
process O
. O
 
We O
observed O
traces O
of O
a O
couple O
of O
these O
incidents O
in O
late O
2013 O
and O
early O
2014 O
on O
a O
victim O
hotel O
's O
network O
. O
 
The B-Entity
attackers I-Entity
set O
up O
the O
environment O
and O
hit B-Action
their B-Entity
individual I-Entity
targets I-Entity
with B-Modifier
precision B-Entity
. O
 
As O
soon O
as O
their O
target O
's O
stay O
was O
over O
and O
the O
attack-frame O
was O
closed O
, O
the B-Entity
attackers I-Entity
deleted B-Action
their B-Entity
iframe I-Entity
placement I-Entity
and I-Entity
backdoored I-Entity
executables I-Entity
from B-Modifier
the B-Entity
hotel I-Entity
network I-Entity
. O
 
The B-Entity
attackers I-Entity
successfully O
de- B-Action
leted I-Action
traces B-Entity
of I-Entity
their I-Entity
work I-Entity
from B-Modifier
earlier B-Entity
attacks I-Entity
in I-Entity
another I-Entity
hotel I-Entity
, O
but O
their O
offensive O
techniques O
were O
the O
same O
. O
 
Outside O
reports O
of O
the O
same O
activity O
at O
other O
hotels O
provide O
enough O
data O
to O
confirm O
the O
same O
careful O
operations O
there O
. O
 
The O
attack O
technique O
blurs O
the O
line O
between O
a O
couple O
of O
common O
APT O
tactics O
; O
fairly O
inaccurate O
'' O
watering O
holes O
'' O
or O
'' O
strategic O
web O
compromises O
'' O
and O
more O
accurate O
spearphishing O
techniques O
. O
 
In O
this O
case O
, O
the O
Darkhotel O
attackers O
wait O
for O
their O
victim O
to O
connect O
to O
the O
Internet O
over O
the O
hotel O
Wi-Fi O
or O
the O
cable O
in O
their O
room O
. O
 
There O
is O
a O
very O
strong O
likelihood O
the O
targets O
will O
connect O
over O
these O
resourc- O
es O
, O
and O
the O
attackers O
rely O
on O
that O
likelihood O
, O
much O
like O
at O
a O
watering O
hole O
. O
 
But O
the B-Entity
attackers I-Entity
also O
maintain B-Action
truly B-Entity
precise I-Entity
targeting I-Entity
information I-Entity
over B-Modifier
the B-Entity
victim I-Entity
's I-Entity
visit I-Entity
, O
much O
like O
they O
would O
know O
a O
victim O
's O
email O
address O
and O
content O
interests O
in O
a O
spearphishing O
attack O
. O
 
While O
setting O
up O
the O
attack O
, O
the O
Darkhotel O
attackers O
knew O
the O
target O
's O
expected O
arrival O
and O
departure O
times O
, O
room O
number O
, O
and O
full O
name O
, O
among O
other O
data O
. O
 
This O
data O
enables O
the B-Entity

to O
present B-Action
the B-Entity
malicious I-Entity
iframe I-Entity
precisely B-Modifier
to I-Modifier
that B-Entity
individual I-Entity

. O
 
So O
, O
here O
we O
have O
yet O
another O
unique O
characteristic O
of O
this O
attacker O
- O
they O
employ O
a O
loosely O
certain O

highly O
precise O
offensive O
approach O
