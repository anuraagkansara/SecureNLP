<heading>Introduction</heading>

The ETSO APT Attack Analysis is based on analysis conducted by A-FIRST, the AhnLab digital forensic team. This report provides a detailed nature of Advanced Persistent Threats which were led by “ETSO Hacking Group” (referred to as ETSO, ETSO Attack or ETSO Hacking Group hereinafter) since 2010. Based on incidents at 12 companies, this report shows how the ETSO APT attacks progressed, which methods were used at each stage of the attacks and the results of the ETSO malware analysis.

AhnLab named the malicious code, which has targeted a specific industry, as “ETSO” since March 3, 2011. The statistics in this report are extracted from AhnLab Smart Defense, a cloud-based malware analysis system, known as ASD.

APT attacks by ETSO Attack Group began with the distribution of malware on July 18, 2011. Until now, ETSO Attack Group has fiercely attacked multiple companies for various purposes such as stealing business know-how of online game companies as well as for certificates and cyber money. ETSO Attack Group commits attacks entirely for reasons of financial profit.

In the APT attacks against the companies in Korea, the ETSO Attack Group used encrypted communication between the master which generated the malware, monitored the system and managed the C2 agent, and the agent which accessed the C2 server. The ETSO Attack Group penetrated the targeted network via the C2 agent and remained dormant for a long period of time without any abnormal behavior that would trigger a network error or website compromise, thus making it difficult to detect the attacks.

<figure><caption>Figure 1. Malware Toolkit of ETSO Group</caption></figure>


AhnLab analyzed two malware toolkits of ETSO and confirmed they were the same or very similar to the malware “Winnti,” named by Kaspersky Labs and the malware toolkit “TrendMicro Plug” named by TrendMicro.

Considering that the ETSO Attack Group used the email accounts of the security division of the target company to distribute more malicious emails through the employee accounts and reacted in real-time to security responses and the business schedule of the target, it is assumed that there were Korean natives or multilingual persons among the attack group.

As the ETSO APT attacks have progressed, the malicious codes used in the attacks have consistently improved and become more sophisticated since 2011. The attacker has been very unpredictable or rather, creative, and has not left any traces. This has made digital forensics as the only method applicable for extracting the appropriate data in unallocated areas in order to analyze and respond to the ETSO APT attacks.

<heading>Statistics of APTs by ETSO</heading>

The C&Cs (Command & Control) attacked by ETSO were mainly located in South Korea, Hong Kong, China and the US, reaching a peak of 64.30% of all attack locations. The C&C servers which were used to attack Korean game companies came primarily through IPs from South Korea and Taiwan.

Normally, there are specific game servers for specific countries. When the entire IPs were blocked from a certain country, the attacker would use another country’s IPs and continue on with the attack.

South Korea was the primary victim of the ETSO APT attacks with an infection rate of 85.6 percent. The
nature of the attack was geared towards the internet game industry, of which South Korea has the most
clients.

<heading>1. Characteristics of the ETSO APT Attack</heading>

<heading>1.1. Penetrating the internal network using an external update server</heading>

In order to penetrate a company’s internal network, the ETSO Attack Group used an external update server. First, the group seized the update server of application program, which is most frequently used since these types of programs are not highly managed and easy to attack. The attacker then changed the update setting file to be downloaded on to the user’s system. Finally, the module of the application program in the user’s system reads the modified setting file and downloads to execute the malicious codes from the server which was built by the attacker.

Since this type of attack is hard to detect, the attack was much more likely to succeed bringing about a catastrophic result with a single attack since many users use the application update server. Moreover, the attacker who seizes the update server targets a specific IP bandwidth of the company rather than randomly distributing malicious codes. The reason why the attacker opts for the former is because random distribution that scatters malicious codes are more likely to be discovered and may be more easily detected by security products.

<figure><caption>Figure 6. Malicious Codes Distributing Process Using the Update Server</caption></figure>


</section>

<section>               
<heading>1.2. Using Pass the Pass, Pass the Hash technique to move within the network</heading>

Once the malicious code penetrates the internal network, it will acquire various kinds of information using the
user account. The attacker obtains the ID, password, NTLM hash value from the registry and memory area
and moves on laterally to another system. The attack process is as follows:

Using the user account information, the attacker creates an agreement with the network sharing system of
the target system and the malicious code is then copied. The work schedule is registered and the copied
malicious code is activated. This type of attack is called the Pass the Pass, Pass the Hash attack method.
The ETSO Attack Group used tools such as gsecdump, which was already disclosed before, WCE (Windows
Credentials Editor), and mimikatz; or, alternatively, they may have used DLL (wceaux.dll, sekurlsa.dll), which
were inserted in the malicious code to attack the system.

Such attacks are possible because most systems within the company often use the same local administrator
ID and Password for the sake of convenience. Or within the Active Directory, it tends to use the same domain
administrator account to access multiple systems, leaving the domain admin ID, password and hash value in
the memory.

</section>

<section>
<heading>1.3. Attack Continues Exploiting Certificates</heading>

The ETSO Attack Group signed the malicious codes using the certificate they obtained. The reason for stealing certificates lies in the fact that files that are not signed by a legitimate certificate will be detected by security products. Therefore, besides attacking the updates for cyber money and personal information, the stealth quality of certificates was also one of the attack goals of the ETSO Group. This indicates the characteristic of the attack, which shows that the multiple attacks were made by a single group.
</section>


<section>
<heading>1.4. Using Anti-Forensic Tactics</heading>

In order to hide oneself, the attacker used more than one anti-forensic tactic. The ETSO Attack Group copied the batch file when copying the malicious codes via network sharing, and it was this batch file that proceeded with anti-forensic techniques. The batch file used the malicious code and cl option from the work schedule file (.job), and the wevtutil option to delete the event logs (Security, System and Application). These types of anti-forensic tactics make forensic analysis difficult, hindering the effort to find the entrance of attack through back-tracing.


<figure><caption>Figure 8. Batch File Proceeding with Anti-Forensic Tactic</caption></figure>

                                          
</section>

<section>
<heading>1.5. Attack Continues Even When Discovered</heading>

The ETSO Attack Group attacks for monetary reasons. For example, the Group attacks cyber money updates and personal information. Even if the attack is detected by security products, the attack continues on with the purpose of interfering with the service and ultimately destroying the system. Once the DB is accessed by the attack, the malicious codes continue to be distributed, creating an overflow to keep a connection with the C&C server, even when the system admin or analyzer finds the malicious codes and deletes them. Thus, it is very difficult to block the attack if all of the attacks are not analyzed well and dealt with all at once.

<section>
<heading>1.6. Attack Techniques Improve with the Passage of Time</heading>

Table 4 shows the footprints of the attacker and a summary of the response. The ETSO Attack Group is seen here to have improved its attack technique in various ways as time passes.

In early days, ETOS hacking group used random file names, algorithms, and path for installing malicious files. As time passed, however, they changed the naming scheme to sound similar with normal file names or system rules making malicious codes detection difficult.

<section>
<heading>2. ETSO APT Attack Techniques by Level</heading>

<heading>2.1. Initial Compromise</heading>

This is the first stage where the attacker first tries to enter the company’s internal network. Many times, the ETSO Attack Group targets the update server, which is the most frequently used application program in the company. The attacker will seize the server and change the settings so that the malicious codes are downloaded on a specific target system. Another method is to disguise itself as an internal mail, enticing the user to open and execute the file. In this case, the attacker disguises oneself as an employee from a security division, sending out email with a malicious hyper link. It has been found that the attack email is written in Korean, indicating that there are native Korean speakers in the ETSO Attack Group.

<figure><caption>Figure 9. APT Mail Using the Documents Acquired from a Game Company</caption></figure>

</section>

<section>
<heading>2.2. Establishing a Foothold</heading>

The attacker that succeeded in initial attack creates a backdoor to the system and prepares a path for continuous attack. In this case, the first attack is mainly made on the employee’s network regularly used for general work. In the case of the ETSO Attack Group, the back door generation program made it possible for many techniques to be executed with a variety of “back doors” to communicate with the C&C. The common functions of each of the back doors are as follows:

- System Information and Control
- Search option
- File transfer to C&C server
- Control of process and module
- Service control
- Registry control
- Instant screen capture
- Remote control
- Command Shell
- Proxy function (open port)
- Keylogging

In addition to the above mentioned ways, in order to secure the additional attack route to the network, the ETSO Group uploaded the back door on the internal file server that was openly shared within the company. The uploaded back door was disguised as a generally used program such as a driver, Office or Chrome install file. Such disguised features induce users to install the file.

<figure><caption>Figure 10. File Menu of ETSO Backdoor Generating Program (Top: Infected PC file. Bottom: Master file information)</caption></figure>

</section>

<section>
<heading>2.3 Escalation of Privileges</heading>

The attacker who successfully installed the back door on the initial attack, then moved on to the target system. In order to progress, the attacker needed to access an account from a higher authority such as information from an administrator, including ID, password and NTLM Hash information, all available in the system registry and memory. In the case of the ETSO Group, they would use existing tools such as gsecdump, WCE(Windows Credential Editor), mimikatz or insert the DLL (wceaux.dll, sekuralsa.dll) in the malicious code, dropping and calling the information. In addition, the attacker may use its key logging function from the backdoor to steal the ID/Password.

For the sake of convenience, the same IDs and Passwords are mainly used for all of the local system administrators. Also, a domain administrator account is used to access more than one system in the active directory setting. In this case, the attacker can easily acquire the administrator’s ID/Password as well as the hash value.

<figure>                 <caption>Figure 11. Acquiring Domain Administrator’s NTLM Hash through WCE</caption></figure>

</section>

<section>
<heading>2.4. Lateral Movement</heading>

The attacker who obtained the account information of privilege authority then created a back door to the system. In this case, if the acquired account was the domain administrator’s, then the attacker could install back doors on all of the corresponding parts of the domain as well as the domain and systems in trust relations. The install process is as follows:

The attacker will use the acquired ID/Password or NTLM Hash value to create an agreement with the system network to move to, and copy, the back door. The copied backdoor is then executed using the work scheduler, and it is operated using the system authority. The executed back door then broadcasts connection status with the C&C server using the proxy feature, and the attacker approaches the corresponding system based on the broadcast information.

The attacker repeats the process until the target system is found, such as a DB. In most cases, the attacker will search for an administrator’s system inside the network, approach the gateway server and finally enter the server network. From then on, the attacker uses the same method and installs many back doors in the server network.
</section>

<section>
<heading>2.5 Maintain Network Presence</heading>

The attacker uses various Reloading Point techniques in order to maintain the connection between the installed back door and the C&C server. First, a Bootkit technique will be used to load the backdoor after transforming the MBR. The characteristic of the bootkit is that the corresponding bootkit is encoded with XOR on the loading data inside the trash and it is saved. Another method is to use files such as wiarpc.dll, tsvipsrc.dll which are loaded automatically during booting. The malicious file such as the DDL is saved under folder 32 and is used during the back door reloading. Registering the back door as a general service is also one way it may be used.

The attacker uses various kinds of anti-forensic techniques in order to avoid being disconnected with the C&C server once the back door is discovered. The backdoor install file and batch file are copied by network sharing, and the batch file is executed with the work scheduler. The batch file executes the back door install file and deletes the install file as well as the work schedule file (.job), and the cl of the wevtutil command is used to delete the event logs (security, system and application). Additionally, the registry key values are deleted in order to erase traces of the back door execution into the service. With these anti-forensic techniques, the attacker reduces the backdoor detection rate, avoiding the chances of being caught by back tracing.

In addition, a method of installing backdoor only in the memory area was applied, since this can avoid the threat detection of security products. After installation, the backdoor erases all of the files and only exists in the memory while waiting for the system to turn off. When the system is turned off, the files needed for back door reloading are generated and they are loaded during system booting. Then, the loaded back door erases all of the related files and stays only in the memory.

Even though administrators and analysts detect back doors and delete them, the attacker will install even more back doors on the system to maintain its connection with the C&C server.

<heading>2.6. Compromised Data</heading>

The attacker who approaches the DB server will proceed with various kinds of tasks depending on the attack purpose such as attacking the cyber money or stealing personal information. In the case of a cyber-money update, a query request is made on the DB using the features embedded on the back door and by SQLCMD.EXE. Or, the existing Stored Procedure is changed to update. When the Stored procedure registered in the mail table is changed and the mail is received, the Stored Procedure is operated to update the cyber money of a specific character. Also, the DDL which is used in the MS SQL DB which transforms the opends60.dll (SQL Open Data Services DLL), can be used to update the cyber money.

In case of information leakage, a DB for a customer information dump file is generated, compressed as BZIP (bz2) and exported out using FTP.

On the top portion of the master, there are two main menus: agent list and agent master. The center area shows the directory of the agent lists which are connected, and the bottom portion shows variety of options related to the master.

<section>
<heading>2. Network Traffic Analysis</heading>

<heading>2.1. Characteristic of the Traffic</heading>

In the initial access, a request for connection is made from an infected remote PC to the master. If the Three-Way Handshake is made between the two, the PC and master will be connected and the information of infected PC will be delivered to the master.

<figure><caption>Figure 16. Connected Traffic between Master and Agent</caption></figure>

Then, after every 60 seconds, the Keep-Alive traffic will be created to check the connection between the master and the infected PC.

<figure><caption>Figure 17. Keep-Alive Traffic between the Master and the Agent</caption></figure>
                        
</section> 

<section>
<heading>2.2. Traffic Encoding</heading>

In the same OS environment, the same IP and Port were used during the test. It has been found that the traffic is different in its delivery over the same command. After repeated tests, a pattern was found in the traffic between the infected PC and the master. Thus, it is surmised that it was not completely encrypted but was encoded by a certain level.

Including the initial connection, the traffic encoding was also applied in the Keep-Alive traffic and in the all command transferred traffic. The Key logging and CMD command results were also not delivered in plain text but in encryption.

<figure><caption>Figure 18. Encoded Traffic (When a service administration command is delivered in the same environment, different traffic patterns are found.)</caption></figure>

Currently, the communication between the ETSO malicious code master and the agent is being encrypted. It seems impossible to create a PCRE and REGEX pattern which can be blocked by IDPS and other network security system. Regarding the newest version of ETSO, it is assumed that there must be a telecommunicating module hiding within the network traffic.
</section>

<section>
<heading>3. Profile of the ETSO Creation Tool</heading>

The question is thus raised regarding who actually made the ETSO Attack tool in the first place. An investigation was conducted to find the ESTO APT creator as the ETSO master’s traces were traced back in the analysis.

In the ETSO master, you can see the http access on the lower menu of the malware toolkit; the Baidu URL values are seen. Baidu is the largest portal site in China. In the middle, you can see the string “DZKSJDADBDCDH-DOCADOCADOCBDDZJS”. The string appears when the IP is entered and information is changed, setting the initial value to be ”127.0.0.1”. At this time, the value DZKSJDADBDCDHDOCADOCADOCBDDZJS is set.

<figure> <caption>Figure19. Distinctive String in the ETSO Malware Toolkit</caption></figure>


Through a Google search of the ‘DZKSJDADBDCDHDOCADOCADOCBDDZJS’ string on the malware toolkit, a link of ‘http://tieba.baidu.com/p/1103191865’ was found. There were reply messages titled TEST and all of the messages were submitted by a person with the ID “whg0001”. This value matches the one on the ETSO malware toolkit.

It is assumed that the attacker designated a specific blog address when the ETSO APT malicious code agent was activated in order to immediately determine whether the attack was successful or not. The attacker can know the victim’s IP address after decrypting the encryption.

<figure><caption>Figure 20. The Website ‘http://tieba.baidu.com/p/1103191865’</caption></figure>

It is assumed that the according blog content is related to the APT tool creation. Thus, a further investigation was made on the person with the ID of whg0001.

When the link of whg0001 is clicked, brief information on the person with the ID whg0001 appears. He is a male who was born and still lives in Szechuan, Chengdu.

On his blog, whg001 wrote on Aug. 17, 2011, “I visited my home school a couple days ago. Looking back, those were the happiest days.” It has also been found that the comment came from the free-board of Jipu High School. Thus, it has been determined that whg001 attended Jipu High School.

<figure><caption>Figure 22. Content on whg0001’s Blog</caption></figure>

According to the writings on the board and the content of whg0001’s blog, the name of the writer is Jiao Xang Bo, who entered high school in 1994 in homeroom number 4. Also, he was looking for a classmate by leaving a message with his QQ ID. whg0001’s QQ ID is found to be (312016).

Unfortunately, the attacker freeboard does not exist anymore. [Figure 24] translates as follows:

         1. I have realized all of the packets’ MIMA (password/man in the middle attack) different when designing the Trojan horse.

         2. To go around the vaccine detection, a transformation and other technologies were used to on the Trojan horse.

To find the document made by whg0001, the ID was used to search on Baidu. As a result, a document titled “VTCP Introduction and Entry(V11.X)” was discovered. To take a closer look at the document, a link (‘http://wenku.baidu.com/view/2005a703-bb68a98270fefa06?fr=prin’) was accessed (as of August, www.cnasm.com, the address mentioned within the document, was no longer accessible).

<heading>Conclusions</heading>
The Chinese-originated APT Attack Group ETSO has been attacking South Korea since 2011. A-FIRST from AhnLab has done a forensics analysis using the ASDE (AhnLab Smart Defense Enterprise) network and on the damaged company for years. According to the study, ETSO is different from other attackers in following ways:

- ETSO analyzes the update structure of a product popularly used in South Korea, in order to distribute malicious codes through reliable products and ultimately, the company.

- To continuously benefit monetarily and acquire extra information, the ETSO Group does not destroy the infected system and the infrastructure.

- By disclosing the digital certificate, additional damage is made on the target company because the certificate can be used in other attacks for different purposes.

- The attacker moves into the internal system by seizing the AD server of the company to attack, using the pass the hash attack.

- Regarding the malicious code file naming, a ‘DLL search order hijacking’ is used (for example: wiarpc.dll, tsvipsrc.dll).

-Not only was the feature embedded on the back door used to attack the cyber money update, but a direct DB query through SQLCMD.EXE, Trigger through the transformation of Store Procedure registered in the email table and opends60.dll(SQL Open Data Services DLL) transformation were all used in the MS SQL DB in the attack.
