                <heading>Unveiling an Indian Cyberattack Infrastructure</heading>

  This report details a sophisticated cyberattack infrastructure that appears to originate from India,
  conducted by private threat actors with no evidence of state-sponsorship. It has likely been in
  operation for over three years, primarily as a platform for surveillance against targets of national
  security interest that are mostly based in Pakistan and possibly in the United States. It is also
  used for industrial espionage against the Norwegian telecom corporation Telenor and other civil-
  ian corporations. Evidence points to professional project management and outsourcing of key
  tasks, including some by freelance programmers.

  On March 17, 2013 a Norwegian newspaper reported that the country’s telecommunications giant
  Telenor had filed a criminal police case for an unlawful computer intrusion. Spear phishing
  emails targeting upper management appeared to be the source of the infection

  Through extensive analysis, security analysts at Norman Shark in conjunction with our partners,
  quickly uncovered a previously unknown and sophisticated infrastructure for targeted attacks.

<heading>Cyberattack Objectives</heading>
The primary purpose of this long-running, global command-and-control net-                      
work appears to be surveillance against national security interests. Private-
                                                                                                             ···
sector industrial espionage in fields as diverse as natural resources, telecommu-
nications, law, food & restaurants, and manufacturing is likely a secondary pur-           
pose of this network.

<heading>Target Selection</heading>                                                                           
Based on analysis of IP addresses collected from criminal data stores discov-
ered during the investigation, it appears that potential victims have been target-
ed in over a dozen countries, most heavily represented by Pakistan, Iran, and the          
United States. Targets include government, military, and civilian organizations

<heading>Highly-Targeted Social Engineering Tactics</heading>
Spear phishing to carefully-selected target individuals was the primary attack
vector identified in the investigation. The attackers went to great lengths to             
make the social engineering aspects of the attack appear as credible and applica-
                                                                                           
ble as possible.
                                                                                             
In many cases, decoy files and websites were used, specifically geared to the              
particular sensibilities of regional targets including cultural and religious sub-
ject matter. Victims would click on what appeared to be an interesting docu-               
ment, and begin the long-running infection cycle.

<heading>Exploit Tools and Techniques</heading>
                                                                                             
Despite all of the recent media attention on so-called “zero-day” exploits en-
                                                                                           
compassing brand new, never-before-seen attack methods, Operation Hangover
appears to have relied exclusively upon well-known, previously identified vul-
                                                                                           
nerabilities in Java, Word documents, and web browsers.
                                                                                           
Favored methods include documents infected with malicious code, along with                 
direction to malicious websites with names deliberately similar to legitimate
government, entertainment, security related, and commercial sites. Often the               
user would be presented with a legitimate document or software download they               
were expecting to see, along with an unseen malicious download.

<heading>Infrastructure Development</heading>
Operation Hangover utilizes a very extensive and sophisticated command-and-                
control infrastructure, likely developed over many months or years by numer-
ous developers. Our investigation revealed evidence of professional project                
management practices used to design frameworks, modules, and sub-
                                                                                           
components. Individual malware authors were assigned certain tasks, and com-
                                                                                             
ponents were “outsourced” to what appear to be freelance programmers.

<heading>Attribution of Responsibility</heading>
                                                                                             
In recent months, much focus has been on China – including both state-
sponsored and individual actors – but Operation Hangover contains notable
hallmarks of originating exclusively in India. We base this attribution with a
very high degree of confidence on our extensive analysis of IP addresses, web-          
site domain registrations, and text-based identifiers contained within the mali-
cious code itself. All indications point to private syndicates of threat actors           
following their own motivations, with no direct evidence of state-sponsorship             
                                                                                          
by the Indian government or by any other nation.
