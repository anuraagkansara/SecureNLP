BlackEnergy is a toolkit that has been used for years by various
criminal outfits. In the summer of 2014, we noted that certain
samples of BlackEnergy malware began targeting Ukranian
government organizations for information harvesting. These
samples were identified as being the work of one group,
referred to in this document as “Quedagh”, which has a history
of targeting political organizations.

The Quedagh-related customizations to the BlackEnergy
malware include support for proxy servers and use of
techniques to bypass User Account Control and driver
signing features in 64-bit Windows systems. While monitoring
BlackEnergy samples, we also uncovered a new variant used by
this group. We named this new variant BlackEnergy 3.

The use of BlackEnergy for a politically-oriented attack is an
intriguing convergence of criminal activity and espionage. As
the kit is being used by multiple groups, it provides a greater
measure of plausible deniability than is afforded by a custom-
made piece of code.

<section>
<heading>INTRODUCTION</heading>
BlackEnergy is a popular crimeware (that is, malware            
designed to automate criminal activities) that is sold in the   
Russian cyber underground and dates back to as early as         
2007. Originally, it was designed as a toolkit for creating     
botnets for use in conducting Distributed Denial of Service     
(DDoS) attacks. Over time, the malware has evolved to           
support different plugins, which are used to extend its         
capabilities to provide necessary functions, depending on       
the purpose of an attack.                                       
                                                                
Given the nature of its toolkit, BlackEnergy has                
unsurprisingly been used by different gangs for different       
purposes; some use it for sending spam, others for stealing
banking credentials. The most notorious use may be when         
it was used to conduct cyberattacks against Georgia during      
the Russo-Georgian confrontation in 2008.                       
                                                                
In the summer of 2014, BlackEnergy caught our attention         
when we noticed that samples of it were now tailored to         
target Ukrainian government institutions. Though it may
be unrelated, it is interesting to note that this change
conveniently coincides with the on-going crisis in that
country. Related or not, one thing is certain: the actor(s)
using these customized BlackEnergy malware are intent
on stealing information from the targets. The use of this
crimeware in what constitutes as an advance persistent
threat (APT) attack is interesting. In ‘black operations’
(black ops), an important criteria is that the attack should
not be attributable - and what provides better plausible
deniability than crimeware known to be used by multiple
parties?

In this paper we focus only on BlackEnergy samples
known to be used specifically by the actors we identify
as Quedagh, who seem to have a particular interest in
political targets. Special focus will be on the samples
that were used in targeted attacks against Ukrainian
government organizations earlier this year.

ATTACK OVERVIEW
At the time of writing, we have little information on how       
exactly victims are receiving the BlackEnergy malware           
being pushed by the Quedagh gang. An educated guess             
is that they are receiving the malware via targeted emails      
containing malicious attachments. Meanwhile, the                
following infection and technical details are based on          
samples gathered after searching through F-Secure Labs’         
collection of all BlackEnergy samples and identifying           
those with Quedagh characteristics.

The BlackEnergy toolkit comes with a builder application
which is used to generate the clients that the attacker(s)
use to infect victim machines. The toolkit also comes
with server-side scripts, which the attackers set up in
the command and control (C&C) server. The scripts also
provide an interface where an attacker can control his
bots. The simplicity and convenience provided by the
toolkit means that anyone who has access to the kit can
build his own botnet without any skills required.

The original BlackEnergy toolkit first emerged in 2007 and       
is referred to in this paper as BlackEnergy 1. A later variant   
of the toolkit (BlackEnergy 2) was released in 2010. We also     
encountered a previously unseen variant, which had been          
rewritten and uses a different format for its configuration.     
It also no longer uses a driver component. We dubbed this        
new variant BlackEnergy 3.

<section>                                                                 
<heading>INFECTION VECTORS</heading>                                                
Most of the recent BlackEnergy installers collected are          
named msiexec.exe. We believe they are either dropped            
by another executable that uses social engineering tricks        
to mislead the user into executing the installer, or by          
documents containing exploits that silently perform the          
installation.
                                                                 
We found at least 2 trojanized legitimate applications that      
execute the installer (in addition to their legitimate tasks).   
Trojanization is an effective infection method, as most
users have no way of observing that a malicious component
is being installed in tandem with a legitimate program.

Some earlier installer variants, then named regedt32.
exe, were distributed by documents exploiting software
vulnerabilities, one of which was CVE-2010-3333. These
documents drop and execute the installer, then open a
decoy document. It is reasonable to assume that a similar
approach has been used to deliver the more recent
installer variants.

The installer filename of BlackEnergy 3 is still msiexec.exe.
However, it is delivered and executed by a dropper which
opens a decoy document in the foreground. We also
encountered a standalone, non-persistent sample that
pretends to be Adobe Flash Player Installer. It does not use
any decoy document or application and does not run after
reboot.

The overview below summarizes the various infection
vectors used by the Quedagh gang to deliver BlackEnergy
crimeware to the designated targets.

<heading>TARGET DETAILS</heading>
From the very earliest variants we were able to attribute              
to Quedagh, we have noticed that their targets have been               
political in nature. Apart from other indicators, we can
deduce the nature of the target based on the content of
social engineering tactics used to distribute the installers.
For example, one decoy dropped from a sample dating to
2012 (image 2) seems to be targeting European audiences
and discusses a political/economic situation. Strings found
in another sample from 2012 (image 3) again indicate
a political motivation behind the attack. Most decoys
used content taken from news sites; we noted one decoy
dropped by an exploit document was created using the
Russian version of Office (image 4).

          <caption>Image 3:
Strings from a sample circa 2012</caption>

The latest variant of the dropper pretends to be a
document file with a Ukrainian filename (image 5).
The choice of language for the filename again may tie
in or reference the current political crisis in that country.
The filename itself means ‘password list’ in English.

<heading>2008 CYBERATTACKS ON GEORGIA?</heading>
During our investigation, we found interesting details
that lead us to suspect that Quedagh might have been
involved in the cyberattacks launched against Georgia
during the 2008 Russo-Georgian confrontation. While the
details identified are suggestive, they are not conclusive;
they do however seem consistent with the group’s
involvement in subsequent targeted attacks.

<heading>UKRAINE-RELATED PROXIES</heading>                                              
While examining the samples collected during our                     
BlackEnergy monitoring, we noticed that samples from
this year had been updated to support the use of proxy
servers while connecting to their C&C servers. This
contrasts with earlier BlackEnergy 2 variants, which do
not support proxy servers. In some network setups, a
proxy server is needed to allow internal users to access
the Internet <fn>[1]</fn>. BlackEnergy¹s use of a proxy server may
indicate that the gang has prior knowledge of the target
organization’s internal setup to note of this requirement.

For example, in one sample the configuration uses
the proxy server associated with the Ukrainian Railway
(image 6). The configuration from another sample
also shows it using an internal proxy under the giknpc
domain (image 7). The domain giknpc.com.ua in turn
hosts 3 domains (image 8), one of which is for the city
of Dnipropetrovsk (image 9), the fourth-largest city in
Ukraine, located in the southeast. Based on the set proxy
servers for the different samples, we concluded that the
gang is targeting Ukrainian government organizations.

<section>
<heading>TIMELINE</heading>
Although they may have started much earlier, the earliest
BlackEnergy sample we could attribute to the Quedagh
gang is from December 14, 2010.

Initially, the group seemed to prefer to use the filename of     
the Windows registry editor (regedt32.exe), presumably           
because the installer needs administrator rights to install
its driver component and therefore would try to request
for the highest available rights (image 10), if possible. As
this triggers a notification message visible to the user, said
user is more likely to grant permission if it appears to be
the registry editor that is requesting for permission, since
it is normal to run it with administrator rights. Experienced
users though are less likely to be taken in, thereby
decreasing the likelihood of a successful infection.

<figure></figure>
                  <caption>Image 10:
Installer requesting highest available rights</caption>

Starting April 2013, modified installers appeared showing
that the Quedagh group found a way to bypass the default
User Account Control (UAC) settings. With this change,
the user’s permission is no longer need (image 11). At this
point, the gang also began to use the Windows installer
program filename msiexec.exe.

<figure></figure>
                  <caption>Image 11:
Installer execution privilege level amended</caption>
</section>

<section>
<heading>64-bit support</heading>
Within a month of Windows 8.1’s release, the gang
had quickly added support for 64-bit systems, possibly
anticipating that more of their target systems will be
migrated to 64-bit systems. They also employ a neat
trick to bypass the driver signing requirement on 64-            
bit Windows systems. As a side note, this latest finding         
updates and supercedes previously published research
related to BlackEnergy’s driver signing behavior <fn>[2]</fn>.

However, this trick doesn’t work on Windows 8 and
later systems. The driver also crashes occassionally. This
could be the reason for the stand-alone non-persistent
BlackEnergy variant.
</section>

<section>
<heading>BlackEnergy 3</heading>
We identified the new BlackEnergy 3 variant first by the
change in its configuration, which differed from those
of its two predecessors, 1 and 2 (images 12 to 14). It also
no longer uses a driver component [3]. Further technical
details are documented on page 10 to 11.

If not, it will re-launch itself as Administrator on Vista.   
This in effect will trigger a UAC prompt. On Windows 7        
and later however, the malware will attempt to bypass the     
default UAC settings. It exploits a backward-compatibility    
feature found in newer versions of Windows. BlackEnergy       
installers include a Shim Database, or a “fix”, instructing   
SndVol.exe to execute cmd.exe (image 15, below) instead       
in order to resolve the incompatibility.                      
                                                              
SndVol.exe is one of the Windows executables that will        
be automatically elevated upon execution because it
is thought to be safe. What harm can a volume control         
cause? With the malicious “fix” installed however,            
executing SndVol.exe will execute the not-so-safe file        
cmd.exe instead, which can then be used to install the        
malware while in an elevated state.

<heading>DRIVER SIGNING POLICY BYPASS</heading>
The role of the installer is to set up the malware’s
persistent component, which is the driver component.
On 64-bit Windows systems, Microsoft has enforced a
policy that requires all drivers to be signed as a security
precaution. Signing provides a way to identify a driver to
its author, effectively reducing the number of malware
developers willing to take the risk. To allow developers to
test their drivers during development, Microsoft provides
a TESTSIGNING boot configuration option; while in this
mode, a watermark is displayed on the screen to make it
obvious to users and to prevent malware from exploiting
this option.
BlackEnergy enables the TESTSIGNING option to load its
driver component; to hide this change from the user, the
malware removes the watermark by removing the relevant
strings in the user32.dll.mui of the system. In Windows
8 and up however, the strings are no longer stored in
user32.dll.mui, so the trick will not work. This may be one
of the reasons for the existence of a standalone non-
persistent BlackEnergy variant. The malware does not
infect 64-bit Windows systems that are older than Vista.

 <heading>HIJACKING EXISTING DRIVERS</heading>                                          
 The installer will try to locate an existing driver service         
 that is inactive. The service found will usually be a               
 legitimate one that is disabled because it is no longer             
 used or because it is set to start only on demand. The              
 installer will drop the driver component using the
 corresponding path of the service. It will overwrite the            
 existing driver if necessary. The hijacked service is then          
 set to start automatically. This is how the malware is able         
 to survive after a reboot. By doing this, the gang may be           
 hoping that their malicious driver will be overlooked by            
 administrators or investigators who are so used to seeing           
 those legitimate services.                                          
 </section>

 <heading>DRIVER COMPONENT</heading>
The only component that will remain permanently on the
infected system will be the driver component. The driver
component used by the gang is a stripped down version
of the BlackEnergy 2 driver.

The sole purpose of this driver component is to inject
the main DLL component into svchost.exe. Interestingly,
it does not contain the rootkit functionalities for hiding
processes, files and registry objects that is found in the
usual BlackEnergy 2 drivers. The gang may have opted for
a ‘hide in plain sight’ approach to evade detections from
rootkit scanners, such as GMER and RootkitRevealer, that
checks for system anomalies.

The driver component provides a IOCTL interface to
communicate with the main DLL component. Table 1
(above) summarizes the command codes that can be
passed to the IOCTL buffer. The 32-bit version contains
additional, incomplete routines for hiding processes via
direct kernel object manipulation (DKOM) and managing
BlackEnergy 2 rootkit rules in memory <fn>[2]</fn>.

BlackEnergy 2 was very well documented by Dell                  
SecureWorks [5] in 2010. Table 2 (above) summarizes             
the differences between the driver component used by            
Quedagh compared to the typical BlackEnergy 2.

<section>                                                                
<heading>MAIN DLL COMPONENT</heading>                                              
The core functionality of BlackEnergy 2 is found in the
main DLL component. This component is embedded inside
the driver component and is not found in the file system;
                                                                
this is to reduce the infection footprint on the system.        
                                                                
The main DLL provides a robust framework for attackers          
to maintain a botnet that is not tied to any specific           
functionality. The malware is designed to be used by            
loading customized plugins depending on the purpose             
of the botmaster. It is mainly a framework for plugins          
to communicate with a central command and control.              
Otherwise, the main DLL only provides a minimal set of
commands. Table 3 (above) summarizes the commands
supported by the variants used in the attack against
Ukrainian government organizations.

In BlackEnergy 2, the main DLL component communicates
with its plugins via a defined set of API calls. It exports
a number of function calls, which can be used by the
plugins. On the other hand, plugins are required to export
2 functions to work. We highly recommend the research
of Dell SecureWorks for those looking for more details
regarding the BlackEnergy 2 plugin framework.

<heading>BLACKENERGY 3</heading>
In contrast to previous variants, BlackEnergy 3 uses a
simpler installer component. It does not have a driver
component and the installer drops the main DLL
component directly to the local application data (non-
roaming) folder. The installer then creates a LNK file in the
startup folder, using a filename generated based on the
volume serial number as a launch point. The LNK file is a
shortcut to execute the main DLL using rundll32.exe.

This variant uses a new configuration format. The               
configuration data is a series of X509_ASN encoded values       
                                                                
and are accessed by an ID number. Table 4 summarizes

BlackEnergy 3 also uses a different method of                   
communication with its plugins, as it now communicates          
via RPC over the named-pipe protocol (ncacn_np).

<heading>INFORMATION-STEALING PLUGIN</heading>                                     
                                                                
Since the main DLL component offers little clue as to what      
the malware was used for, we need to look at the plugin to      
determine the objective of the gang.                            
                                                                
One particular plugin that was used in the campaign was         
called “si”, perhaps to mean ‘steal information’. The latest    
sample we found will attempt to gather the following            
information and send them to the C&C server: 
<list>

The nature of the information being gathered seems to
be generic rather than targeted. This may be because the
malware has roots from crimeware. The information is still
useful however as such data makes it easier for the gang
to plan any further attacks on the same targets.

BlackEnergy communicates with its C&C server via HTTP               
POST requests. For the BlackEnergy 2 samples used by the            
gang, the request contains the following fields:                    
<list>                                                                   
     id=[bot_id]&bid=[base64_encoded_build_
                                                                    
           id]&dv=[x]&mv=[y]&dpv=[z]
</list>                                                                   
Where:
                                                                    
  •	 bot_id is equivalent to the infected host name                 
     and the volume serial number following the
     format x[host_name]_[serial_no] (e.g. xJOE-                    
     PC_484DA98A)                                                   
  •	 build_id is the string found in the build_id field in          
     the sample’s configuration data
  •	 x, y, z are hardcoded values which varies among                
     samples
                                                                    
The fields are almost the same for BlackEnergy 3 samples:
<list>
  id=[bot_id_sha1]&bid=[base64_encoded_build_
           id]&nm=[x]&cn=[y]&num=[z]
</list>
The only major difference is that the id field contain just
the hash instead of the actual string. The actual bot_id
string in which the id hash is derived is also a bit different;
it now uses the format [domain_sid]_[host_name]_
[serial_no].
The response of the command and control server will
be encrypted using the id field in the POST request as
the key. After the response is decrypted, it will be in the
form of the corresponding configuration data of the
BlackEnergy sample; for example, BlackEnergy 2 samples
expect the decrypted response to be a XML document,
while BlackEnergy 3 samples expect the decrypted
response to be a series X509_ASN encoded values.
The decrypted response, which is equivalent to another
configuration data, will be processed similar to the initial
configuration data embedded in the main DLL; the only
differences are the data fields that are processed. This
cycle is illustrated in diagram 3 (above).
The main DLL also uses the fields listed in table 6 (above)
when it needs to download additional files.

<section>
<heading>CONCLUSIONS</heading>
BlackEnergy is a toolkit that has been used for years
by various criminal outfits. In the summer of 2014, we
noted that certain samples of BlackEnergy malware
began targeting Ukranian government organizations for
information harvesting. These samples were identified as
being the work of one group, referred to in this document
as “Quedagh”, which has a history of targeting political
organizations. Though inconclusive, suggestive details
indicate that BlackEnergy malware, possibly also from this
gang, may also have been used in the Russo-Georgian
confrontation in 2008.

The Quedagh-customizations to the BlackEnergy malware
include support for proxy servers (which, in the samples
examined are associated with Ukrainian entities) and
use of techniques to bypass User Account Control and
driver signing features in 64-bit Windows systems. While
monitoring BlackEnergy samples, we also encountered a
new variant, which we dub BlackEnergy 3, with a modified
configuration, no driver component and a different
installation procedure.

The use of BlackEnergy for a politically-oriented attack
is an intriguing convergence of criminal activity and
espionage. As the kit is being used by multiple groups, it
provides a greater measure of plausible deniability than is
afforded by a custom-made piece of code.
