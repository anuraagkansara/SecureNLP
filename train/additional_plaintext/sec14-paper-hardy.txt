Targeted attacks on civil society and non-governmental        
organizations have gone underreported despite the fact        
that these organizations have been shown to be frequent       
targets of these attacks. In this paper, we shed light on     
targeted malware attacks faced by these organizations by      
studying malicious e-mails received by 10 civil society       
organizations (the majority of which are from groups re-      
lated to China and Tibet issues) over a period of 4 years.    
   Our study highlights important properties of malware       
threats faced by these organizations with implications on     
how these organizations defend themselves and how we          
quantify these threats. We ﬁnd that the technical sophis-     
tication of malware we observe is fairly low, with more       
effort placed on socially engineering the e-mail con-         
tent. Based on this observation, we develop the Targeted
                                                              
Threat Index (TTI), a metric which incorporates both so-

sessing the risk of malware threats. We demonstrate that
                                                              
this metric is more effective than simple technical sophis-

Civil society organizations (CSOs), working on hu-            
man rights issues around the globe, face a spectrum           
of politically-motivated information security threats that    
seek to deny (e.g. Internet ﬁltering, denial-of-service at-   
tacks), manipulate (e.g. website defacements) or moni-        
tor (e.g. targeted malware) information related to their      
work. Targeted malware attacks in particular are an in-       

creasing problem for CSOs. These attacks are not iso-
lated incidents, but waves of attacks organized in cam-
paigns that persistently attempt to compromise systems
and gain access to networks over long periods of time
while remaining undetected. These campaigns are cus-
tom designed for speciﬁc targets and are conducted by
highly motivated attackers. The objective of these cam-
paigns is to extract information from compromised sys-
tems and monitor user activity and is best understood as
a form of espionage. CSOs can be particularly suscep-
tible to these threats due to limited resources and lack
of security awareness. Targeted malware is an active re-
search area, particularly in private industry. However,
focused studies on targeted attacks against CSOs are rel-
atively limited despite the persistent threats they face and
the vulnerability of these groups.
   In this study, we work with 10 CSOs for a period of
4 years to characterize and track targeted malware cam-
paigns against these groups. With the exception of two
groups that work on human rights in multiple countries,
the remaining eight groups focus on China and Tibet-
related human rights issues. We focus on targeted mal-
ware typically delivered via e-mail that is speciﬁcally tai-
lored to these groups as opposed to conventional spam
which has been well characterized in numerous previous
works <fn>[27, 42, 45, 52, 70, 71]</fn>. We consider the threats to
these groups along two axes: the technical sophistica-
tion of the malware as well as sophistication of the so-
cial engineering used to deliver the malicious payload.
We combine these two metrics to form an overall threat
ranking that we call the Targeted Threat Index (TTI).
While other scoring systems exist for characterizing the
level of severity and danger of a technical vulnerabil-
ity <fn>[7, 17, 41, 50]</fn>, no common system exists for ranking
the sophistication of targeted e-mail attacks. TTI allows
us to gain insights into the relative sophistication of so-
cial engineering and malware leveraged against CSOs.
   A key to the success of our study is a unique method-
ology, combining qualitative and technical analysis of

e-mails and their attachments with ﬁeldwork (e.g. site          
visits) and interviews with affected CSOs. This method-            
ology, which we describe in more detail in Section 3, al-          
lows us to both accurately rate the level of targeting of e-
mail messages by interfacing with CSOs participating in
our study (Section 4.2), and understand the relative tech-         
nical sophistication of different malware families used in
the attacks (Section 4.3). By combining the strengths of           
our qualitative and quantitative analysis, we are able to
                                                                   
accurately understand trends in terms of social engineer-
                                                                   
ing and technical sophistication of politically-motivated
                                                                   
targeted malware threats faced by CSOs.
                                                                   
   Our study makes the following observations, which
                                                                   
have implications for security strategies that CSOs can
                                                                   
employ to protect themselves from targeted malware:
                                                                   
Attachments are the primary vector for email based                 
targeted malware. More than 80% of malware deliv-                  
ered to Tibet-related organizations in our study and sub-          
mitted to us is contained in an e-mail attachment. Fur-            
ther, for 2 of the 3 Tibetan organizations in our study            
(with at least 40 submitted e-mails), simply not opening           
attachments would mitigate more than 95% of targeted               
malware threats that use email as a vector.                        
Targeted malware technical sophistication is low. So-              
cial engineering sophistication is high We ﬁnd that                
the technical sophistication of targeted malware deliv-            
ered to CSOs in our study is relatively low (e.g., rela-           
tive to commercial malware that has been found targeting           
CSOs and journalists <fn>[35,36,38]</fn> and conventional ﬁnan-             
cially motivated malware), with much more effort given
                                                                   
to socially engineering messages to mislead users. This
                                                                   
ﬁnding highlights the potential for education efforts fo-

technical security solutions to help protect CSOs.
                                                                   
CSOs face persistent and highly motivated actors.                  
For numerous malware samples in our study we ob-                   
serve several versions of the software appearing over              
the course of our four year study. These multiple ver-             
sions show evidence of technical improvements to com-
                                                                   
plement existing social engineering techniques.
                                                                   
   Since the start of our study we have participated in            
a series of workshops with the participating Tibetan or-
ganizations to translate these results into a training cur-        
riculum. Speciﬁcally, we have educated them about how              
to identify suspicious e-mail headers to identify spoofed          
senders and demonstrated tools that can be used to check           
e-mailed links for malware and drive-by-downloads.                 
   The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Sec-            
tion 2 presents relevant background on targeted malware            
and attacks on CSOs. Our data collection methodology               
is described in Section 3. We describe our targeting and           
technical sophistication metrics as well as how we com-            
bine them to produce the Targeted Threat Index (TTI)

work are discussed in Section 5. We present related work
in Section 6 and conclude in Section 7.

2     Background</heading>
2.1    Targeted Malware Overview
Targeted malware are a category of attacks that are dis-
tinct from common spam, phishing, and ﬁnancially mo-
tivated malware. Spam and mass phishing attacks are
indiscriminate in the selection of targets and are directed
to the largest number of users possible. Similarly, ﬁnan-
cially motivated malware such as banking trojans seek
to compromise as many users as possible to maximize
the potential proﬁts that can be made. The social engi-
neering tactics and themes used by these kinds of attacks
are generic and the attack vectors are sent in high vol-
umes. By contrast targeted malware attacks are designed
for speciﬁc targets, sent in lower volumes, and are moti-
vated by the objective of stealing speciﬁc sensitive data
from a target.
   Targeted malware attacks typically involve the follow-
ing stages <fn>[24, 66]</fn>:
Reconnaissance: During this stage attackers conduct
research on targets including proﬁling systems, software,
and information security defenses used to identify possi-
ble vulnerabilities and contextual information on person-
nel and activities to aid social engineering.
Delivery: During this stage a vector for delivering
the attack is selected. Common vectors include e-mails
with malicious documents or links, or contacting targets
through instant messaging services and using social en-
gineering to send malware to them. Typically, a target of
such an attack receives an e-mail, possibly appearing to
be from someone they know, containing text that urges
the user to open an attached document (or visit a web-
site).
Compromise: During this stage malicious code is exe-
cuted on a target machine typically after a user initiated
action such as opening a malicious document or link.
Command and Control: During this stage the infected
host system establishes a communications channel to a
command and control (C&C) server operated by the at-
tackers. Once this channel has been established the at-
tackers can issue commands and download further mal-
ware on to the system
Additional attacker actions: After a successful com-
promise is established, attackers can conduct a number of
actions including ex-ﬁltrating data from the infected host
and transmitting it back to attackers through a process
of encrypting, compressing, and transferring to a server
                                                               2

operated by the attackers. Attackers may also use pe-           
ripherals such as webcams and microphones to monitor               
users in real time. The infected host may also serve as            
a starting point to infect other machines on the network           
and seek out speciﬁc information or credentials.                   
                                                                   
                                                                   
2.2    Targeted Malware and CSOs                                   
Targeted malware has become recognized by govern-                  
ments and businesses around the world as a serious po-             
litical and corporate espionage threat. The United States          
government has been particularly vocal on the threat tar-
geted malware enabled espionage poses. General Keith               
Alexander, current Director of the National Security
Agency and Commander of United States Cyber Com-                   
mand has stated that the theft of US intellectual property         
through cyber espionage constitutes the “greatest transfer         
of wealth in history” <fn>[47]</fn>. Recent widely publicized tar-          
geted malware intrusions against Google, RSA, the New              
York Times and other high proﬁle targets have raised               
public awareness around these attacks <fn>[20, 44, 48]</fn>                 
    Despite this increased attention, targeted malware is
not a new problem, with over a decade of public reports
                                                                   
on these kinds of attacks <fn>[66]</fn>. However, the majority
of research on targeted malware is conducted by private            
security companies who typically focus on campaigns                
against industry and government entities. As a result, tar-        
geted attacks on civil society and non-governmental or-            
ganizations have gone underreported despite the fact that          
these organizations have been shown to be frequently               
targeted by cyber espionage campaigns. In particular,              
communities related to ethnic minority groups in China             
including Tibetans, Uyghurs, and religious groups such             
as Falun Gong have been frequent targets of cyber es-              
pionage campaigns with reports dating back to at least             
2002 <fn>[61]</fn>.                                                         
    In some cases, the same actors have been revealed to           
be targeting civil society groups, government and indus-           
try entities. A notable example of this was the 2009 re-           
port by the Citizen Lab, a research group at the Univer-           
sity of Toronto, which uncovered the “GhostNet” cyber              
espionage network. GhostNet successfully compromised               
prominent organizations in the Tibetan community in ad-            
dition to 1,295 hosts in 103 countries, including min-             
istries of foreign affairs, embassies, international organi-       
zations, and news media <fn>[25]</fn>. The GhostNet case is not             
an isolated example, as other reports have shown CSOs              
(commonly Tibetan organizations) included as targets in            
campaigns that are also directed to a range of govern-             
ment and industry entities <fn>[8, 26, 28, 29, 54–56]</fn> Some of          
these reports include technical details on the CSO spe-            
ciﬁc attacks <fn>[26, 28, 54, 55]</fn> while others note them as a          
target but do not address in detail <fn>[8, 29, 56]</fn>.                   
    While the majority of documented targeted malware              

   campaigns against CSOs involve China and Tibet-related
groups and potentially China-related attack operators
<fn>[9–11, 23, 25, 26, 32, 61–65, 67, 68]</fn> , these kinds of at-
tacks go beyond China. Recent research and news media
have reported attacks against large human rights groups
focused on multiple issues and countries <fn>[31, 46]</fn>, and
communities related to Syria <fn>[18]</fn> and Iran <fn>[37]</fn>. Re-
searchers have also uncovered the use of commercial
network intrusion products used to target activists from
Bahrain <fn>[38]</fn>, the United Arab Emirates <fn>[36]</fn>, and jour-
nalists from Ethiopia <fn>[35]</fn>.

3     Data collection</heading>
Since our study involves dealing with e-mail messages
which may contain personally identiﬁable information
(PII) and collection of information from CSOs who need
to maintain privacy of their data, we consulted with our
institutional research ethics board during the design of
our study. The methods described below have been sub-
mitted to and approved by this board.
3.1    Study Participants
We recruited participants via three main channels: (1)
an open call on our Web site, (2) outreach to organi-
zations we had prior relationship with and (3) referrals
from participating groups. As part of the study these
groups agreed to share technical data (e.g., e-mails with
suspicious attachments) and participate in interviews at
the onset and end of the study. Their identity and any PII
shared with us were kept strictly conﬁdential.
   For the purposes of our study, we focused on organiza-
tions with missions concerning the promotion or protec-
tion of human rights. For purposes of this study, ”human
rights” means any or all of the rights enumerated under
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights <fn>[60]</fn>, the In-
ternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights <fn>[58]</fn>,
and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights <fn>[59]</fn>. We also considered organizations
on a case by case basis that have a mission that does not
directly implicate human rights, but who may nonethe-
less be targeted by politically motivated digital attacks
because of work related to human rights issues (e.g., me-
dia organizations that report on human rights violations).
   In total, 10 organizations participated in the study
(summarized in Table 1). The majority of these groups
work on China-related rights issues and ﬁve of these or-
ganizations focus speciﬁcally on Tibetan rights. The high
rate of participation from China and Tibet-related human
rights issues is due in part to our previous relationships
with these communities and a signiﬁcant interest and en-
thusiasm expressed by the groups. In addition to the
China and Tibet-related groups, our study also includes        
                                                               3

and consist of small virtual teams collaborating remotely,        
often from home ofﬁces. Of these groups only two                  
(China Group 1, China Group 3) have a dedicated system            
administrator on staff. Other groups (Tibet Groups 1-5;           
China Group 2) rely on volunteers or staff with related           
technical skills (e.g. Web development) to provide tech-          
nical support. Rights Group 1 and Rights Group 2 are              
much larger organizations relative to the others in our
sample. Both organizations have over 100 employees,
multiple ofﬁces, dedicated IT teams, and enterprise level
computing infrastructures.

3.2    Data Sources                                               
We collect the following pieces of information from the           
participant groups in order to understand the malware             
threats they face:                                                
                                                                  
User-submitted e-mail messages. Our primary data                  
source is a collection of e-mails identiﬁed by participants       
as suspicious which were forwarded to a dedicated e-              
mail server administered by our research team. When               
available these submissions included full headers, ﬁle
attachments and / or links. There are three key limita-
tions to relying on user-submitted e-mails for our anal-          
ysis. First, we are only able to study e-mails identiﬁed
by participants as suspicious, which may bias our re-             
sults to only reporting threats that have been ﬂagged by          
users. Further, individuals may forget to forward e-mails         
in some cases. Relying on self-reporting also creates bias        
between groups as individuals at different organizations          
may have different thresholds for reporting, which cre-           
ates difﬁculties in accurately comparing submission rates         
between groups. Thus the amount of threat behaviour               
we see should be considered a lower bound on what oc-             
curs in practice. Second, having participants forward us          
e-mails does not allow us to verify if the targeted organi-       
zation was successfully compromised by the attack (e.g.,          
if another member of the organization open and executed           
malware on their machine) and what the scope of the at-           
tack was. Finally, e-mail is only one vector that may be          
used to target organizations. Other vectors include water-        
hole attacks <fn>[21]</fn>, denial of service attacks, or any other        
vectors (e.g., physical threats like infected USB sticks).        
These limitations mean that it is possible that we did not        
comprehensively observe all attacks experienced by our            
study groups and some more advanced attacks may have              
gone unreported.                                                  
   Recognizing the limitations of e-mail submissions, we          
complement user submitted emails with data from Net-

work Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) alerts, web-
site monitoring, and interviews. Also, upon request of
study groups who were concerned of possible infection
we analyzed packet capture data from suspect machines.
Through the course of this supplementary analysis we
did not ﬁnd indications of malware compromise that
used samples that were not included in our pool of user-
submitted emails. In this paper we focus on reporting
results from analyzing the user submitted emails through
the TTI. The NIDS and website monitoring components
were added later in our study and do not signiﬁcantly
contribute to TTI analysis. <fn>1</fn>

3.3    Overview of User-Submitted E-mails
The e-mails examined in this study span over four years,
from October 14, 2009 to December 31, 2013. Data col-
lection began on November 28, 2011, but China Group
3 and Tibet Group 1 forwarded us their pre-existing
archives of suspicious emails, resulting in e-mail sam-
ples dating back to October 14, 2009. In total, we re-
ceived 817 e-mails from the 10 groups participating in
our study. Table 2 breaks down the submissions from
each groups and illustrates that submissions were highly
non-uniform across the groups. Thus, in general, we fo-
cus on the groups with at least 50 e-mail submissions for
our analysis.
   Figure 1 shows the cumulative number of e-mail sub-
missions per month over the course of the study. For
example, China Group 3 shared a set of e-mails received
in 2010 by a highly targeted member of the organization,
which can be observed in Figure 1. Tibet Group 1 ac-
counts for the highest number of submissions relative to
the other groups due to being one of the ﬁrst groups in
the study and being persistently targeted by politically
motivated malware. Tibetan Groups 2 and 4, who joined
the study later (in April 2012) show a similar submission
rate to original Tibetan Group 1, suggesting these groups
are targeted at a similar rate. In Section 4.2, we investi-
                                                              4

   We further classify e-mails as malicious if they include                                      
attached malware, a direct link to malware or a site with                                        
a drive-by download, or a link to a phishing page. Fig-

groups that submitted at least 25 e-mails to our system.                                         
The most common approach employed in these e-mails                                               
was attaching a malicious payload to the e-mail itself.                                          
However, we notice a higher rate of phishing attacks on                                          
the China-related groups and the rights groups working                                           
on multiple international human rights issues. In partic-
ular, 46% of the e-mails submitted by China Group 1,
and 50% of the e-mails submitted by Rights Group 1, di-                                          
rect the user to a phishing Web site. In the case of China

served because this group conﬁgured their spam ﬁlter to                                          
forward e-mails to our system, resulting in us receiving                                         
a large number of generic, non-targeted spam. In con-

Section 4.2.                                                                                     
   The rate of submissions to our project meant that it                                          
was feasible to manually analyze e-mail attachments for
   malware as they were submitted. This analysis gives us
   higher conﬁdence in our results because AV signatures
   are frequently unable to detect new or modiﬁed threats,
   and can overlook the presence of a malicious payload
   that can be easily identiﬁed upon manual inspection (e.g.
   shellcode in an RTF exploit). In total, we analyzed 3,617
   payload ﬁles and found 2,814 (78%) of them to be ma-
   licious. Section 4.3 describes our analysis methodology
   in more detail.

   Our dataset includes a wide range of targeted malware
   threats varying in level of both social engineering and
   technical complexity. This range presents a challenge
   in ranking the relative sophistication of the malware and
   targeting tactics used by attackers.
      While scoring systems such as the Common Vulnera-
   bility Scoring System <fn>[17]</fn> exist for the purpose of com-
   municating the level of severity and danger of a vul-
   nerability, there is no standardized system for ranking

                                                                                                       5

the sophistication of targeted email attacks. This gap is       
likely because evaluating the sophistication of the target-        
ing is non-technical, and cannot be automated due to the           
requirement of a strong familiarity with the underlying
subject material.                                                  
   To address this gap we developed the Targeted Threat
Index (TTI) to assign a ranking score to the targeted ma-          
licious emails in our dataset. The TTI score is intended           
for use in prioritizing the analysis of incoming threats,          
as well as for getting an overall idea of how severely an          
organization is threatened.                                        
   The TTI score is calculated by taking a base value de-          
termined by the sophistication of the targeting method,            
which is then multiplied by a value for the technical              
sophistication of the malware. The base score can be               
used independently to compare emails, and the combined             
score gives an indication of the level of effort an attacker       
has put into individual threats.

   TTI scores range from 1 to 10, where 10 is the most

4.2    Social Engineering Tactics                                  
                                                                   
We leverage a manual coding approach to measure the                
sophistication of social engineering tactics used in the at-       
tacks observed by the organizations in our study. While            
automated approaches may be explored in the future, this           
manual analysis allows us to have high conﬁdence in our            
results, especially since understanding the social engi-           
neering often required contextual information provided             
by the organizations in our study. To quantify the level           
of sophistication, we manually analyse the e-mail subject          
line, body, attachments and header ﬁelds. We perform an            
initial content analysis by coding the e-mails based on            

   their semantic content, and then use these results to gen-
erate a numerical metric quantifying the level of targeting
used.
4.2.1   Content coding and analysis results
We code the e-mails based on their subject line, body, at-
tachments and headers using the following methodology:
Subject line, body, and attachments. The content of
the subject line, body and attachments for each submitted
e-mail were content coded into 8 themes, each contain-
ing categories for speciﬁc instances of the theme: Coun-
try / Region (referring to a speciﬁc geographical country
or region); Ethnic Groups (referring to a speciﬁc ethnic
group); Event (referring to a speciﬁc event); Organiza-
tions (referring to speciﬁc organizations); People (refer-
ring to speciﬁc persons), Political (reference to speciﬁc
political issues), Technology (reference to technical sup-
port), Miscellaneous (content without clear context or
categories that do not fall into one of the other themes).
Table 3 summarizes the themes and provides examples
of categories within each theme.
E-mail headers. The header of each e-mail was an-
alyzed to determine if the sending e-mail address was
spoofed or the e-mail address was otherwise designed
to appear to come from a real person and / or organiza-
tion (e.g. by registering an e-mail account that resembles
a person and / or organization’s name from a free mail
provider). We divide the results based on whether they
attempted to spoof an organization or a speciﬁc person.
   Using this manual analysis, we perform a content anal-
ysis of e-mails submitted by the organizations. Results
of this analysis conﬁrm that social engineering is an im-
portant tool in the arsenal of adversaries who aim to de-
liver targeted malware. Speciﬁcally, 95% and 97% of
e-mails to Chinese and Tibetan groups, respectively, in-
cluded reference to relevant regional issues. Spooﬁng
of speciﬁc senders and organizations was also prevalent
with 52% of e-mails to Tibetan groups designed to ap-
pear to come from real organizations, often from within
the Tibetan community. For example, a common tar-
get of spooﬁng was the Central Tibetan Administration
(CTA), referenced in 21% of the spoofed e-mails, which
administers programs for Tibetan refugees living in In-
dia and advocates for human rights in Tibet. While the
number of e-mail submissions were lower for the gen-
eral human rights groups, we observe similar trends there
with 92% of e-mails submitted by Rights Group 1 ap-
pearing to come from individuals in the group (as a result
of spooﬁng).
   In some cases we even observed the same attackers
targeting multiple CSOs with customized e-mail lures.
For example, we tracked a campaign that targeted China
Groups 1 and 2, and Tibet Group 1 with a remote access
                                                               6

trojan we call IEXPL0RE <fn>[22]</fn> China Group 1 received        
the malware in e-mails claiming to be from personal                 
friends whereas China Group 2 received the malware in

by the Dalai Lama, attached to an e-mail about a year in            
review of Tibetan human rights issues.                              
                                                                    
4.2.2   Social Engineering Sophistication Base Value                

While the content analysis results clearly show attacks
tailored to the interests of targeted groups, content cod-          
ing alone does not give a relative score of the sophistica-         
tion used in the attacks. We now describe how we assign             
the “social engineering sophistication base value” to e-            
mails based on their level of social engineering.                   
   To measure the targeting sophistication we assign a              
score that ranges from 0-5 that rates the social engineer-          
ing techniques used to get the victim to open the attach-           
ment. This score considers the content and presentation
of the e-mail message as well as the claimed sender iden-
tity. This determination also includes the content of any           
associated ﬁles, as malware is often implanted into legit-          
imate relevant documents to evade suspicion from users              
when the malicious documents are opened.                            
   The Social Engineering Sophistication Base Value is              
assigned based on the following criteria:                           
0 Not Targeted: Recipient does not appear to be a spe-              
ciﬁc target. Content is not relevant to the recipient. The          
e-mail is likely spam or a non-targeted phishing attempt.
                                                                    
1 Targeted Not Customized: Recipient is a speciﬁc                   
target. Content is not relevant to the recipient or contains        
information that is obviously false with little to no valida-       
tion required by the recipient. The e-mail header and/or            
signature do not reference a real person or organization.           
2 Targeted Poorly Customized: Recipient is a speciﬁc                
target. Content is generally relevant to the target but has         
attributes that make it appear questionable (e.g. incom-            
plete text, poor spelling and grammar, incorrect address-           
ing). The e-mail header and / or signature may reference            
a real person or organization.                                      

         3 Targeted Customized: Recipient is a speciﬁc target.
Content is relevant to the target and may repurpose legit-
imate information (such as a news article, press release,
conference or event website) and can be externally ver-
iﬁed (e.g. message references information that can be
found on a website). Or, the e-mail text appears to re-
purpose legitimate e-mail messages that may have been
collected from public mailing lists or from compromised
accounts. The e-mail header and / or signature references
a real person or organization.
4 Targeted Personalized: Recipient is a speciﬁc target.
The e-mail message is personalized for the recipient or
target organization (e.g. speciﬁcally addressed or refer-
ring to individual and / or organization by name). Con-
tent is relevant to the target and may repurpose legitimate
information that can be externally veriﬁed or appears to
repurpose legitimate messages. The e-mail header and /
or signature references a real person or organization.
5 Targeted Highly Personalized: Recipient is a spe-
ciﬁc target. The e-mail message is individually person-
alized and customized for the recipient and references
conﬁdential / sensitive information that is directly rele-
vant to the target (e.g. internal meeting minutes, com-
promised communications from the organization). The
e-mail header and / or signature references a real person
or organization.
   Content coding of emails and determinations of so-
cial engineering ratings for the TTI were performed by
ﬁve independent coders who were given a code book for
content categories and the TTI social engineering scale
with examples to guide analysis. We performed regu-
lar inter-rater reliability checks and ﬂagged any poten-
tial edge cases and inconsistencies for discussion and re-
evaluation. Following completion of this analysis, two
of the authors reviewed the social engineering base value
scores to ensure consistency and conformity to the scale.
We provide speciﬁc examples of each of these targeting
values in Appendix A.

4.3                              Technical Sophistication                                        
                                                                                                 
We manually analyzed all submitted emails and attach-

motivated malware. The malware is then analyzed in de-

4.3.1                            Assessment methodology
                                                                                                 
The ﬁrst step in our analysis pipeline is determining
whether the email contains politically motivated malware                                         
or not. This process involves an initial inspection for                                          
social engineering of the email message and attachment                                           
(e.g., an executable pretending to be a document). We                                            
also correlate with other emails received as part of this                                        
project to identify already-known malware. Well-known                                            

malware attacks (e.g., the Zeus trojan masquerading as
   an email from the ACH credit card payment processor,
 or Bredolab malware pretending to be from the DHL
courier service) are not considered targeted attacks in our
study, but are still kept for potential review.
     Once we have identiﬁed emails which we suspect of
  containing politically-motivated malware, we perform
the following analysis steps on any attachments to ver-
ify that they indeed contain malware. First, we run the
attachment in a sandboxed VM to look for malicious ac-
tivity e.g., an Ofﬁce document writing ﬁles to disk or try-
ing to connect to a C&C server. We also check the MD5
hash of the attachment against the Virus Total dto
see if it matches existing viruses. We also manually ex-
amine the attached ﬁle for signs of malicious intent (e.g.,
executable payload in a PDF, shellcode or Javascript).
We exclude any graphics attached to the email which are
used for social engineering (and do not contain malicious
payload) from our analysis.
   We follow this initial analysis with more dtech-
nical analysis of the attachments which we conﬁrm con-
tain malware. First, we manually verify the ﬁle type of
the attachment for overview statistics. This manual anal-
ysis is necessary as the Unix ﬁle command may be mis-
led by methods of manipulating important bytes in the
ﬁle (e.g., replacing \rtf1 with \rtf[null]). We t-
tify if the vulnerability included in the malware already
exists in a corpus of vulnerabilities, such as the Com-
mon Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming sys-
tem. We also perform analysis of network trafﬁc from
the attachment to identify the C&C server the malware
attempts to contact. In cases where the malware does
not execute in our controlled environment we manually
examine the ﬁle to extract the relevant information.
   On a case-by-case basis we use additional tools such
as IDA <fn>[1]</fn> and OllyDbg <fn>[3]</fn> for detailed static and dy-
namic analysis, respectively. Our goal in this analysis
is to identify relationships between malware campaigns
between organizations, or instances of the same malware
family repeatedly targeting a given organization. By ob-
serving overlapping C&C servers, or mapping malware
to common exploits identiﬁed by anti virus/security com-
panies we can cluster attacks that we believe come from
the same malware family and potentially the same adver-
sary.
4.3.2   Technical Sophistication Multiplier
While the previous analysis is useful for understanding
the nature of threats, we also score threats numerically to
aid in understanding the relative technical sophistication
of their approaches. Each malware sample is assigned
one of the following values:
1 Not Protected - The sample contains no code protec-
                                                                                                     8

tion such as packing, obfuscation (e.g. simple rotation       
of interesting or identifying strings), or anti-reversing




                                                              
                                                              
tricks.                                                       
                                                              
                                                              
1.25 Minor Protection - The sample contains a sim-            
                                                              
ple method of protection, such as one of the following:
code protection using publicly available tools where the      

reverse method is available, such as UPX packing; sim-        
ple anti-reversing techniques such as not using import        
                                                              
                                                              

tables, or a call to IsDebuggerPresent(); self-disabling in
the presence of AV software.
                                                              
1.5 Multiple Minor Protection Techniques - The sam-           
ple contains multiple distinct minor code protection tech-    
niques (anti-reversing tricks, packing, VM / reversing
tools detection) that require some low-level knowledge.
This level includes malware where code that contains the      
core functionality of the program is decrypted only in        
memory.                                                       
                                                              
1.75 Advanced Protection - The sample contains mi-
                                                              
nor code protection techniques along with at least one
                                                              
advanced protection method such as rootkit functionality
                                                              
or a custom virtualized packer.
                                                              
2 Multiple Advanced Protection Techniques - The               
sample contains multiple distinct advanced protection         
techniques, e.g. rootkit capability, virtualized packer,      
multiple anti-reversing techniques, and is clearly de-        
signed by a professional software engineering team.           
   The purpose of the technical sophistication multiplier     
is to measure how well the payload of the malware can         
conceal its presence on a compromised machine. We use         
a multiplier because advanced malware requires signif-        
icantly more time and effort (or money, in the case of        
commercial solutions) to customize for a particular tar-      
get.                                                          
   We focus on the level of obfuscation used to hide pro-     
gram functionality and avoid detection for the follow-        
ing reasons: (1) It allows the compromised system to          
remain infected for a longer period; (2) it hinders ana-      
lysts from dissecting a sample and developing instruc-        
tions to detect the malware and disinfect a compromised       
system; (3) since most common used remote access tro-
jans (RATs) have the same core functionality (e.g. key-
                                                              
logging, running commands, exﬁltrating data, control-
ling microphones and webcams, etc.) the level of ob-          
fuscation used to conceal what the malware is doing can       
be used to distinguish one RAT from another.

    is seen infrequently. The majority of malware observed
    is rated either 1 or 1.25 according to our technical scoring
    criteria, with Tibetan Groups observing a higher fraction
    of malware rated 1.25 and Chinese groups observing a
    higher fraction rated 1.
       The technical sophistication multiplier value is also
    useful for assessing the technical evolution of threats in
    our study. When we group malware into different fam-
    ily groups we can see some of these groups are under
    active development. For example, we observe multiple
    versions of the Enfal <fn>[40, 49]</fn>, Mongal <fn>[14]</fn>, and Gh0st
    RAT <fn>[15]</fn> families with increasing levels of sophistica-
    tion and defenses in place to protect the malware code
    (resulting in an increase in technical multiplier from 1 to
    1.25 for these families). Since our technical multiplier
    value focuses on how well malware code defends and
    disguises itself, changes to other aspects of the code may
    not result in an increase in value (e.g., we observe multi-
    ple versions of the IMuler.A/Revir.A malware which all
    receive a score of 1). Interestingly, when we observe both
    a Windows and Mac version of a given malware family,
    the technical score for the Mac version tended to be lower
    with the Mac version being relatively primitive relative to
    the Windows variant.

    4.4                               TTI Results
    We now show how the TTI metric can help us better char-
    acterize the relative threat posed by targeted malware.
    Figure 5 shows the technical sophistication multiplier
    and maximum/minimum TTI scores for malware fami-
    lies observed in our dataset. Since we primarily observe
    simple malware, with a technical sophistication multi-
    plier of 1 or 1.25, this value does a poor job of differen-
    tiating the threat posed by the different malware families
    to the CSOs. However, by incorporating both the tech-
    nical sophistication and targeting base value into the TTI
    metric we can gain more insights into how effective these

technically sophisticated, the social engineering lures            
employed are poorly customized for the targets result-                
ing in a 4.0 TTI score (targeting base value 2, technical             
multiplier 2).                                                        
   These results support the idea that different threat ac-           
tors have varying focuses and levels of resources, and                
as a result, different methodologies for attacks. For ex-             
ample, the majority of malware submitted by our study                 
groups appear to be from adversaries that have in-house               
malware development capabilities and the capacity to                  
organize and implement targeted malware campaigns.                    
These adversaries are spending signiﬁcant effort on so-               
cial engineering, but generally do not use technically                
advanced malware. Conversely, the adversaries using                   
FinFisher and DaVinci RCS have bought these products                  
rather than develop malware themselves. However, while                
the FinFisher and RCS samples are technically sophisti-               
cated pieces of malware, the attacks we analyzed are not              
sophisticated in terms of social engineering tactics.

4.5    Limitations of TTI                                             
                                                                      
While the Targeted Threat Index gives insight into the                
distribution of how sophisticated threats are, we are still           
in the process of evaluating and reﬁning it through in-               
teractions with the groups in our study and inclusion of              
more sophisticated threats observed in related investiga-             
tions in our lab. Average TTI scores in our dataset may               
be skewed due to the self-reporting method we use in the              
study. Very good threats are less likely to be noticed and            
reported while being sent to far fewer people, and low-               
quality emails are much more likely to be sent in bulk                
and stand out. It is also possible that individuals in differ-        
ent groups may be more diligent in submitting samples,                
which could affect between group comparisons. We are                  
more interested, however, in worst-case (highest) scores              
and not in comparing the average threat severity between              
organizations.                                                        
   Finally, this metric is calculated based on the technical          
sophistication of the payload, not on the speciﬁc exploit.            
There is currently no method to modify the TTI score in               
a way similar to the temporal metrics used by the CVSS                
metric. A temporal metric could be added to increase                  
the ﬁnal TTI value for 0-day vulnerabilities, or possibly             
to reduce the score for exploits that are easily detectable           
due to a public and well-known generation script, e.g.                
Metasploit <fn>[2]</fn>

5     Implications                                                    
</heading>                                                                      
Our study primarily focuses on threats that groups work-              
ing on human rights issues related to Tibet or China are              
currently facing. While our dataset is concentrated on                
these types of groups, our results have implications for              

   how CSOs can protect themselves against email-based
targeted malware.
   Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that moving towards cloud-based
platforms (e.g., Google Docs) instead of relying on e-
mail attachments would prevent more than 95% of the
e-mail malware seen by 2 out of 3 Tibetan groups that
had more than 50 e-mail submissions.
   Further, our results highlight the potential for lower-
cost user education initiatives to guard against sophis-
ticated social engineering attacks, rather than high cost
technical solutions. This observation stems from the fact
that much of the malware we observe is not technically
sophisticated, but rather relies on social engineering to
deliver its payload by convincing users to open malicious
attachments or links. Other studies <fn>[35, 36, 38]</fn> that have
revealed the use of commercial malware products against
CSOs and journalists have shown that many of these
cases also rely on duping users into opening malicious
e-mail attachments or social engineered instant messag-
ing conversations. These incidents show that even ad-
vanced targeted malware requires successful exploitation
of users through social engineering tactics.
   User education can be a powerful tool against the
kinds of targeted attacks we observed in this study. In-
deed, the Tibetan community has taken an active ap-
proach with campaigns that urge Tibetan users to not
send or open attachments and suggests alternative cloud
based options such as Google Docs and Dropbox for
sharing documents <fn>[53]</fn>. We have also engaged the Ti-
betan groups in a series of workshops to introduce train-
ing curriculum which draws on examples submitted by
organizations participating in our study. We have also
provided them with technical background to identify sus-
picious e-mail headers and how to use free services to
check the validity of suspicious links in e-mail messages.
   The mitigation strategies presented here are focused
on email vectors and do not consider all of the possible
attacks these groups may face. We highlight these strate-
gies in particular because the majority of groups in our
study identiﬁed document-based targeted malware as a
high priority information security concern. The adver-
saries behind these attacks are highly motivated and will
likely adapt their tactics as users change their behaviors.
For example, it is plausible that if every user in a partic-
ular community began to avoid opening attachments and
document-based malware infected fewer targets, attack-
ers may move on to vectors such as waterhole attacks or
attacks on cloud document platforms to ﬁll the gap. User
education and awareness raising activities need to be on-
going efforts that are informed by current research on the
state of threats particular communities are experiencing.
Evaluation of the effectiveness of user education efforts
in at risk communities and corresponding reactions from
attackers is required to understand the dynamics between
                                                                 11

There is a wide body of literature on ﬁltering and detec-
tion methods for spam <fn>[27,42,45,52,70,71]</fn> and phishing             
emails and websites <fn>[12, 34, 39, 69]</fn>. Attention has also
been given to evaluating user behavior around phishing             
attacks and techniques for evading them <fn>[6, 30, 33]</fn>. By            
comparison research on detecting email vectors used for            
targeted malware attacks is limited. A notable excep-              
tion is <fn>[4, 5]</fn>, which uses threat and recipient features           
with a random forest classiﬁer to detect targeted mali-            
cious emails in a dataset from a large Fortune 500 com-            
pany. Other work has focused on imporoving detection               
of documents (e.g. PDF, Microsoft Ofﬁce) with embed-               
ded malicious code <fn>[13, 51, 57]</fn>                                    
   Another area of research explores methods for model-            
ing the stages of targeted attacks and using these mod-            
els to develop defenses. Guira and Wang <fn>[19]</fn> propose               
a conceptual attack model called the attack pyramid to             
model targeted attacks and identify features that can be           
detected at the various stages. Hutchins, Cloppert and             
Amin, <fn>[24]</fn> use a kill chain model to track targeted at-            
tack campaigns and inform defensive strategies.                    
   Metrics have been developed to characterize security            
vulnerabilities and their severity <fn>[7, 41, 50]</fn>. The indus-         
try standard is the Common Vulnerability Scoring Sys-              
tem (CVSS) <fn>[17]</fn>, which uses three metric groups for                
characterizing vulnerabilities and their impacts. These            
groups are: base metric group (the intrinsic and fun-              
damental characteristics of a vulnerability that are con-          
stant over time and user environments), temporal metric
group (characteristics of a vulnerability that change over         
time but not among user environments) and environmen-
tal metric group (characteristics of a vulnerability that          
are relevant and unique to a particular user’s environ-            
ment). The CVSS is a widely adopted metric, but only               
rates technical vulnerabilities. Targeted attacks rely on a        
user action of opening a malicious attachment or visiting          
a malicious link to successfully compromise a system.              
Therefore, the sophistication of message lures and other           
social engineering tactics are an important part of deter-
mining the severity of a targeted attack. Systems like the
                                                                   
CVSS cannot address this contextual component.
   Our study makes the following contributions to the              
literature. Previous studies of targeted attacks against           
CSOs usually focus on particular incidents or campaigns            
and do not include longitudinal observations of attacks            
against a range of CSO targets. While standards exist              
                                                                   
for rating the sophistication of technical vulnerabilities         
and research has been done on detecting targeted mal-
                                                                   
ware attacks and modeling campaigns, there is no scor-             
ing system that considers both the sophistication of mal-          

   ware and social engineering tactics used in targeted mal-
ware attacks. We address this gap through development
of the TTI and validate the metric against four years of
data collected from 10 CSOs.

7    Conclusions
</heading>
Our study provides an in-depth look at targeted malware
threats faced by CSOs. We ﬁnd that considering the
technical sophistication of these threats alone is insuf-
ﬁcient and that educating users about social engineer-
ing tactics used by adversaries can be a powerful tool
for improving the security of these organizations. Our
results point to simple steps groups can take to protect
themselves from document-based targeted malware such
as shifting to cloud-based document platforms instead
of relying on attachments which can contain exploits.
Further research is needed to measure the effectiveness
of education strategies for changing user behaviour and
how effective these efforts are in mitigation of document-
based malware for CSOs. Further work is also required
in monitoring how attackers adapt tactics in response to
observed behavioural changes in targeted communities.
   In ongoing work we are continuing our collection of e-
mails and NIDS alerts as well as monitoring other attacks
against these groups (e.g., waterhole attacks and DoS at-
tacks) to understand how threats vary based on their de-
livery mechanism. We are also working to extend our
methodology to more diverse CSO communities such as
those in Latin America, Africa, and other underreported
regions to better document the politically motivated dig-
ital threats they may be experiencing.

 A     Examples of targeted e-mails
 In this section, we provide speciﬁc examples of e-mails
 that would be assigned targeting scores described in Sec-
 tion 4.2.2.
 Targeting Score 1 (Targeted Not customized). The e-
 mail in Figure 6 was sent to Tibet group 1. The message
 content and sender are vague and do not relate to the in-
 terest of the group. The attachment is a word document
 implanted with malware. The lack of relevant informa-
 tion in this message gives it a score of 1 (targeted, not
 customized).
 Targeting Score 2 (Targeted, Poorly Customized).
 The e-mail in Figure 7 was sent to Tibet group 1. It refer-
 ences Tibetan self-immolations which is an issue of inter-
 est to the group. However, the sender does not appear to
 be from a real person or organization. The message con-
 tent is terse and does not referenced information that can
 be externally validated. Therefore this message scores a
 2 (targeted, poorly customized).

  Figure 8: Example of e-mail with Targeting Score 3
                                                                  

Targeting Score 3 (Targeted Customized).           The e-
                                                                  
mail in Figure 8 was sent to Tibet group 2. On the sur-
face it appears to be a professional e-mail from “Palden          
Sangpo” a consultant at the Tibet Career Centre. The              
e-mail sender address and signature reference accurate            
contact details that can be easily veriﬁed through an In-         
ternet search. However, the e-mail headers reveal the             
purported e-mail sender address is fraudulent and the             
actual sender was albano_kuqo@gmx.com. The e-mail                 
generally addresses the organization rather than the indi-        
vidual recipient. Therefore this message scores a 3 (tar-         
geted, customized).                                               
                                                                  
Targeting Score 4 (Targeted Personalized). The e-                 
mail in Figure 9 was sent to Tibet group 1. It is directly        
addressed to the director of the group and appears to             
come from Mr. Cheng Li, a prominent China scholar                 
based at the Brookings Institute. The e-mail address              
is made to appear to be from Mr. Cheng Li, but from               
an AOL account (chengli.brookings@aol.com) that was               
registered by the attackers. The message asks the recip-          
ient for information on recent Tibetan self-immolations.

  Favour

  Dear [Redacted]
  I am Cheng Li from John L. Thornton China
  Center of Brookings. I will attend an
  annual meeting on Religious Research
  with CIIS in Shanghai next week, and
  plan to take the chance to visit Tibet.
  Attached is a list of tibetans who have
  self-immolated from 2009 which my assistant
  prepared for me, but i am not sure of its
  accuracy. Would you please have a look
  and make necessary corrections. I will be
  really much appreciated if you could do me
  the favor and offer some more information
  about the latest happenings inside tibet.
  Thank you again and happy Tib losar!

  Figure 9: Example of e-mail with Targeting Score 4
this message gives it a score of 4 (targeted, personalized).
Targeting Score 5 (Targeted Highly Personalized).
Targeting scores of 5 (targeted, highly personalized) re-
quire reference to internal information to the target orga-
nization that could not be obtained through open sources.
Examples of messages scoring at this level include an
e-mail that purported to come from a funder of China
Group 3 that provided details of an upcoming meeting
the group actually had scheduled with the funder. In
another example, Tibet Group 2 and Tibet Group 3 re-
ceived separate e-mails that contained speciﬁc personal
details about a South African group’s visit to Dharam-
sala, India that appear to have been repurposed from a
real private communication. The malicious attachment
contained an authentic travel itinerary, which would be
displayed after the user opened the document. The pri-
vate information used in these messages suggest that the
attackers performed signiﬁcant reconnaissance of these
groups and likely obtained the information through prior
compromise.
