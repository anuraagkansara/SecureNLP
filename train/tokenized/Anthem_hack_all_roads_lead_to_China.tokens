When O
news O
of O
the O
Anthem O

was O
reported O
on O
February O
4th O
, O
2015 O
, O
the O
security O
industry O
quite O
understandably O
went O
wild O
. O
 
A O
breach O
of O
this O
magnitude O
was O
certainly O
unprecedented O
. O
 
Naturally O
, O
many O
industry O
professionals O
were O
keenly O
interested O
in O
digging O
into O
this O
incident O
to O
see O
what O
could O
be O
uncovered O
, O
and O
the O

was O
no O

even O
when O

hindered O
by O
a O
relative O
lack O

However O
, O
before O
we O
delve O
into O
what O
we O
were O
able O
to O
uncover O
, O
let O
's O
brie�y O
review O
the O
facts O
as O
they O
stood O
in O
the O
wake O
of O
the O
initial O
discovery O
announcement O
. O
 
On O
the O
morning O
of O
February O
4th O
, O
2015 O
, O
several O
major O
news O
outlets O
broke O
the O
story[7 O
] O
that O
Anthem O
, O
Inc. O
's O
network O
defenses O
had O
been O
breached O
. O
 
According O
to O
a O
statement O
from O
Anthem O
's O
CEO[8 O
] O
, O
the O
company O
fell O
victim O
to O
a O
" O
very O
sophisticated O
external O
cyber O
attack O
, O
" O
and O
the O
hackers O
" O
obtained O
" O
the O
personally O
identi�able O
information O
( O
PII O
) O
of O
approximately O
80 O
M O
customers O
. O
 
This O
included O
social O
security O
numbers O
, O
birthdays O
, O
street O
addresses O
, O
phone O
numbers O
and O
income O
data O
– O
plenty O
of O
information O
to O
enable O
identity O
theft O
. O
 
This O
was O
a O
signi�cant O
event O
for O
several O
reasons O
. O
 
Anthem O
, O
formerly O
known O
as O
Wellpoint O
, O
is O
the O
largest O
managed O
healthcare O
company O
in O
the O
Blue O
Cross O
Blue O
Shield O
Association O
, O
and O
by O
extension O
, O
one O
of O
the O
largest O
healthcare O
organizations O
in O
the O
United O
States O
. O
 
As O
such O
, O
any O
compromise O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
insigni�cant O
, O
would O
likely O
impact O
countless O
individuals O
. O
 
Blue O
Cross O
Blue O
Shield O
provides O
healthcare O
coverage O
for O
about O
half O
the O
U.S. O
 
federal O
workforce O
. O
 
This O
means O
that O
their O
information O
was O
potentially O
compromised O
too O
. O
 
Unlike O
the O
Sony O
hack O
which O
was O
destructive O
in O
nature O
and O
meant O
to O
send O
a O
message O
for O
coercive O
purposes O
, O
the O
Anthem O
compromise O
was O
purportedly O
very O
covert O
, O
a O
fact O
which O
may O
suggest O
something O
about O
the O
adversary O
's O
motives O
. O
 
As O
of O
late O
February O
2015 O
, O
there O
have O
not O
been O
any O
indications O
that O
the O
ex�ltrated O
PII O
data O
was O
immediately O
commoditized O
on O
the O
black O
market O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
enabling O
identity O
theft O
, O
as O
was O
the O
case O
in O
the O
Home O
Depot O
Breach O
. O
 
Obviously O
, O
these O
high O
- O
level O
observations O
do O
not O
provide O
cybersecurity O
researchers O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
information O
to O
work O
with O
. O
 
However O
, O
when O
presented O
within O
the O
context O
of O
a O
Threat O
Intelligence O
Platform O
( O
TIP O
) O
, O
an O
incomplete O
trail O
of O
evidence O
can O
highlight O
intelligence O
gaps O
, O
a O
study O
of O
which O
can O
orient O
threat O
researchers O
towards O
their O
analytic O
objectives O
. O
 
To O
this O
end O
, O
let O
's O
examine O
what O
we O
wanted O
to O
discover O
in O
the O
context O
of O
the O
Anthem O
breach O
: O
Who O
was O
responsible O
for O
the O
attack O
? O
What O
was O
the O
objective O
of O
the O
attack O
? O
Was O
it O
cyber O
theft O
, O
an O
espionage O
operation O
, O
or O
something O
different O
? O
Who O
was O
targeted O
in O
the O
attack O
? O
The O
answer O
to O
this O
question O
, O
obscured O
as O
it O
may O
be O
, O
would O
likely O
shed O
some O
light O
on O
the O
objective O
of O
the O
breach O
. O
 
What O
was O
the O
timeline O
of O
the O
activity O
? O
The O
real O
power O
of O
a O
Threat O
Intelligence O
Platform O
is O
demonstrated O
when O
you O
are O
able O
to O
collect O
and O
maintain O
a O
robust O
dataset O
of O
threat O
indicators O
, O
both O
past O
and O
present O
, O
which O
can O
help O
orient O
you O
in O
the O
right O
direction O
in O
the O
wake O
of O
a O
newly O
discovered O
breach O
. O
 
Even O
when O
you O
do O
not O
have O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
information O
to O
start O
with O
( O
for O
example O
a O
�le O
hash O
, O
or O
an O
IP O
address O
) O
, O
you O
may O
�nd O
leads O
by O
pivoting O
through O
archived O
datasets O
until O
you O
uncover O
key O
pieces O
of O
the O
puzzle O
. O
 
In O
the O
case O
of O
the O
Anthem O

, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
do O
just O
that O
. O
 
In O

that O
Beijing O
Topsec O

one O
of O
the O
largest O
information O

in O
China O
. O
 
In O
1996 O

, O
they O

to O
include O
a O

The O

as O
a O
core O
technical O

for O

at O
the O
2008 O
Olympic O

– O
an O
event O
which O
was O
tightly O
controlled O
by O

. O
 
Additionally O
, O
Beijing O
Topsec O
is O
a O
known O
partner O
of O
the O
Chinese O
military O
. O
 
Since O
2009 O
, O
the O
company O
has O
possessed O
information O

The O

The O
Leaked O
Cable O
A O
very O
compelling O
piece O
of O
evidence O
is O
found O
in O
the O
contents O
of O
a O
leaked O
2009 O
diplomatic O
security O
cable O
from O
the O
Department O
of O
State O
, O
published O
by O
The O
Guardian.[56 O
] O
The O
cable O
is O
a O
daily O
digest O
of O
Diplomatic O
Security O
alerts O
– O
essentially O
a O
situational O
awareness O
primer O
for O
State O
Department O
employees O
to O
inform O
them O
of O
new O
and O
existing O
threats O
. O
 
In O
one O
section O
, O
the O
cable O
highlights O
that O
the O
Founder O
of O
Beijing O
Topsec O
, O
He O
Weidong O
, O
had O
openly O
talked O
about O
receiving O
directives O
from O
the O
PLA O
in O
an O
interview O
with O
China O
News O
Network O
. O
 
In O
the O
interview O
, O
the O
founder O
quite O
curiously O
states O
that O
Topsec O
is O
less O
a O
commercial O
entity O
, O
but O
rather O
a O
research O
institute O
, O
and O
that O
the O
company O
received O
about O
half O
of O
its O
start O
- O
up O
capital O
directly O
from O
the O
PLA O
. O
 
The O
cable O
further O
claims O
that O
Topsec O
actively O
recruits O
for O
the O
PLA O
cyber O
army O
. O
 
[ O
57 O
] O
[ O
58 O
] O
It O
would O
also O
appear O
that O
not O
only O
does O
Beijing O
Topsec O
have O
deep O
ties O
to O
state O
- O
run O
cyber O
activity O
, O
but O
also O
within O
the O
independent O
hacker O
community O
as O
well O

notorious O

Section O
Summary O
: O
It O
is O
not O
surprising O
that O
the O
Chinese O
government O
would O
be O
interested O
in O
partnering O
with O
a O
private O
organization O
such O
as O
Beijing O
Topsec O
for O
use O
as O
a O
front O
for O
state O
- O
sponsored O
activity O
. O
 
The O
association O
between O
Southeast O
University O
and O
Beijing O
Topsec O
as O
manifested O
in O
the O
joint O
information O
security O
research O
center O
highlights O
the O
possibility O
of O
growing O
links O
between O
state O
- O
sponsored O
activity O
and O
academic O
institutions O
, O
particularly O
those O
that O
receive O
funding O
from O
the O
central O
government O
. O
 
All O
in O
all O
, O
it O
would O
seem O
that O
China O
is O
pursuing O
a O
uni�ed O
approach O
to O
cyber O
operations O
, O
relying O
on O
all O
unique O
facets O
of O
the O
workforce O
: O
academia O
, O
private O
industry O
, O
and O
independent O
hackers O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
PLA O
to O
achieve O
their O
strategic O
goals O

The O
Anthem O
breach O
exposes O
the O
insidious O
reality O
of O
modern O
Chinese O
cyber O
espionage O
as O
it O
continues O
its O
unrelenting O
strikes O
at O
the O
soft O
underbelly O
of O
the O
American O
way O
of O
life O
. O
 
Moreover O
, O
it O
demonstrates O
the O
imposing O
yet O
increasingly O
common O
reality O
of O
conducting O
threat O
intelligence O
analysis O
without O
substantial O
threat O
intelligence O
to O
start O
with O
. O
 
Fortunately O
for O
us O
, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
deduce O
informed O
answers O
to O
some O
of O
the O
outstanding O
questions O
to O
this O
breach O
by O
scrutinizing O
our O
archival O
data O
troves O
that O
are O
ef�ciently O
stored O
within O
our O
Threat O
Intelligence O
Platform O
and O
partner O
integrations O
. O
 
In O
the O
�eld O
of O
cyber O
security O
, O
industry O
professionals O
must O
learn O
to O
play O
the O
long O
game O
in O
order O
to O
generate O
a O
proactive O
sense O
of O
situational O
awareness O
, O
allowing O
for O
greater O
ef�ciency O
and O
�exibility O
in O
mitigating O
future O
threats O
. O
 
Additionally O
, O
this O
incident O
underscores O
the O
frustrating O
disparity O
of O
the O
industry O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
naming O
conventions O
. O
 
With O
so O
many O
threat O
actors O
and O
indicators O
�oating O
around O
, O
it O
is O
can O
be O
frustrating O
to O
keep O
track O
of O
all O
the O
disparate O
pieces O
of O
evidence O
, O
especially O
when O
countless O
naming O
conventions O
are O
applied O
. O
 
Without O
the O
use O
of O
a O
Threat O
Intelligence O
Platform O
to O
keep O
track O
of O
the O
�ood O
of O
incoming O
threat O
data O
, O
this O
task O
would O
be O
extraordinarily O
time O
consuming O
at O
best O
and O
crippling O
at O
worst O
. O
 
Moving O
forward O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
bear O
in O
mind O
that O
the O
adversary O
, O
regardless O
of O
country O
of O
origin O
, O
shall O
almost O
certainly O
leverage O
our O
every O
weakness O
against O
us O
. O
 
Even O
something O
as O
seemingly O
innocuous O
as O
confusion O
over O
names O
can O
easily O
consume O
analytical O
bandwidth O
, O
creating O
a O
window O
of O
opportunity O
to O
strike O
. O
 
We O
– O
that O
is O
security O
professionals O
, O
private O
industry O
and O
governments O
alike O
– O
must O
proactively O
harden O
our O
