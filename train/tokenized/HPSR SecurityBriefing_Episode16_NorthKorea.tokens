Republic O
of O
Korea O
( O
DPRK O

, O
known O
in O
the O
West O

is O
a O
unique O
country O
with O
a O
military-focused O
society O

an O
unconventional O

While O
North O

list O
of O
state O
sponsors O
of O
terrorism O
, O
it O
was O
removed O
in O
2008 O

However O
, O
due O
to O
North O
Korea O
's O
hostility O
toward O
other O
nations O
, O
its O
pursuit O
of O
nuclear O
weapons O
, O
and O
human O

violations O
against O
its O
own O
citizens O
, O
the O
United O

and O
many O
Western O
entities O
have O
placed O
sanctions O
and O
embargoes O
against O
North O
Korea O
. O
 
For O
example O
, O
U.S. O
export O
laws O
forbid O
the O
sale O
of O
dual-use O

targeted O
U.S. O

While O
Major O

may O
have O
been O
overly O
optimistic O
about O
North O

it O
is O

interests O
, O
the O

'' O
Scaparrotti O
stressed O
that O
'' O
While O
North O
Korea O

massive O

'' O
While O
one O
would O
expect O
the O
regime O

digital O
infrastructure O
to O
also O
suffer O
from O
aging O
or O
lack O
of O
resources O
, O
these O
factors O
do O
not O
take O
away O
from O
their O
technical O
abilities O
to O
wage O
cyber O
warfare O
. O
 
While O
the O
U.S. O
views O
North O
Korea O
's O
cyber O
warfare O
program O
as O
the O
regime O
's O
foray O
into O
modern O
asymmetrical O
warfare O
, O
South O
Korea O
views O
the O
regime O

cyber O
capabilities O
as O
a O
terroristic O
threat O
, O
-a O
build-up O
for O
an O
impending O
multifaceted O
attack O

It O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
, O
to O
date O

no O

'' O
South O
Korea O
's O
view O
of O
North O
Korea O
as O
a O
terroristic O
threat O
may O
be O
an O
attempt O
to O
downgrade O
North O
Korea O
politically O
, O
since O
South O

does O
not O
recognize O
the O
regime O
as O
a O
legitimate O

While O
this O
claim O
may O
be O
exaggerated O
, O
in O
2012 O
, O
South O
Korean O
reports O
estimated O
North O
Korea O

around O
3000 O

In O
a O
July O

report O
from O

Agency O
, O
that O
figure O
was O
upgraded O
to O
5900 O

. O
 
We O
must O
stress O
that O
although O
these O
claims O
have O
not O
been O
corroborated O
, O
South O
Korea O
has O
taken O
the O
regime O
's O
cyber O
threats O
very O
seriously O
and O
is O
reportedly O
training O
5000 O
personnel O
to O
defend O
against O
North O

cyber O
attacks O
. O
 
Obtaining O
details O
on O
North O
Korea O
's O
cyber O
warfare O
capabilities O
is O
not O
an O
easy O
task O
. O
 
This O
paper O
will O
examine O
the O
known O
cyber O
capabilities O
of O
North O
Korea O
's O
regime O
and O
how O
the O
country O
maintains O
secrecy O
in O
these O
matters O
. O
 
Through O
information O
obtained O
via O
open O
source O
intelligence O
( O
OSINT O
) O
, O
we O
will O
present O
what O
is O
known O
about O
North O
Korea O
's O
cyber O
warfare O
and O
supporting O
intelligence O
and O
psychological O
operations O
capabilities O
. O
 
The O
following O
conditions O
proved O
to O
be O
research O
roadblocks O
when O
gathering O
intelligence O
regarding O
North O
Korea O
's O
cyber O
warfare O
capabilities O
: O
 O
Much O
of O
the O
intelligence O
available O
on O
North O
Korea O
is O
dated O
and O
may O
not O
accurately O
reflect O
the O
regime O
's O
current O
capabilities O
. O
 
 O
Much O
of O
the O
intelligence O
available O
on O
North O
Korea O
comes O
from O
U.S. O
or O
South O
Korean O
military O
or O
agency O
reports O
. O
 
These O
reports O
omit O
details O
that O
are O
likely O
classified O
, O
such O
as O
specific O
IP O
addresses O
and O
individual O
actor O
information O

 O
While O
South O
Korea O
is O
an O
ally O
of O
the O
United O
States O
, O
its O
reports O
on O
North O
Korean O
cyber O
activity O
potentially O
contain O
incomplete O
or O
biased O
information O
. O
 
Cultural O
factors O
that O
stem O
from O
a O
history O
of O
tension O
and O
conflict O
between O
the O
two O
nations O
may O
skew O
perception O
and O
make O
objectivity O
difficult O
. O
 
 O
North O
Korea O
's O
Internet O
infrastructure O
and O
the O
regime O
's O
strict O
control O
over O
its O
use O
ensures O
that O
there O
are O
no O
rogue O
actors O
and O
that O
all O
officially O
sanctioned O
actors O
exercise O
careful O
OPSEC O
and O
PERSEC O
practices O
in O

to O
prevent O
inadvertent O

significant O
identifying O
information O
in O
the O

This O
hinders O
collection O
of O
original O

 O
North O
Korea O
is O
well-isolated O
from O
the O
outside O
world O
, O
and O
its O
strong O
intelligence O
and O
psychological O
operations O
presence O
effectively O
creates O
confusion O
via O
counterintelligence O
and O
disinformation O
about O
the O
regime O

capabilities O
. O
 
For O
this O
reason O
, O
any O
'' O
official O
'' O
reports O
emanating O
from O
North O
Korea O
must O
be O
taken O
with O
a O
grain O

This O
also O
hinders O

In O

for O
Westerners O
to O
understand O
the O

necessary O
to O
examine O
the O
key O
components O
of O
North O
Korean O
political O

It O
is O

of O
how O
North O
Korea O
and O
South O

view O
one O
another O
, O
in O
order O
to O
understand O
the O
basis O
for O
conflict O
between O
the O
two O

North O
Korea O
has O
two O
primary O
ideologies O
that O
provide O
context O
for O
the O

motivations O
and O
activities O
: O
juche O

and O
songun O
( O

. O
 
Juche O
is O
the O
official O
political O
ideology O
of O
North O
Korea O
. O
 
It O
was O
instituted O
in O
1972 O
and O
is O
based O
on O
the O
ideologies O
of O
Kim O
Il-Sung O
, O
the O
founder O
of O
the O
DPRK O

Juche O
emphasizes O
self-reliance O
, O
mastering O

and O
reconstruction O
in O
one O

, O
being O
independent O
of O

philosophy O
explains O
North O
Korea O

disdain O
for O

cultural O
and O
political O

Juche O
challenges O
North O
Koreans O
to O
contribute O
to O
the O
regime O

chaju O
( O
ja-ju O
) O
, O
a O
concept O
of O
national O
sovereignty O

The O

greatest O
fear O
is O
internal O
dissent O
and O

destabilization O

In O

session O
, O
Dr. O
Andrei O
Lankov O
, O
an O
expert O
on O
North O
Korean O
culture O
and O
society O
, O
noted O
'' O
there O
are O
also O
serious O
signs O
of O
public O
alienation O
and O
discontent O
. O
 
And O
I O
can O
not O
rule O
out O
a O
public O
outbreak O
of O
such O
discontent O
in O
the O
near O
future O
. O
 
Of O
course O
, O
if O
it O
happens O
, O
it O
will O
have O
a O
serious O

'' O
Despite O
North O
Korea O
's O
strong O
conviction O
in O
juche O
, O
the O
regime O
collaborates O
with O
and O
receives O
support O
from O
other O
nations O
. O
 
However O
, O
due O
to O
this O
deep-seated O
ideology O
, O
it O
is O
doubtful O
that O
North O
Korea O
fully O
trusts O
these O
apparent O
allies O
. O
 
Later O
in O
this O
document O
, O
we O
will O
show O
that O
North O
Korea O
relies O
heavily O
on O
China O
for O
Internet O
access O
. O
 
North O
Korea O
also O
collaborates O
with O
China O

to O

emphasizes O
the O
priority O
of O
the O
military O
in O
resource O
allocation O
and O
political O
and O

This O
doctrine O
stems O
from O
the O
belief O
that O
the O
military O
is O
vital O
for O

Without O

continued O
well O

to O

the O

Neither O
nation O
recognizes O
the O
other O
as O

legitimate O
state O
. O
 
South O
Korea O
's O
constitution O
legally O
defines O
South O
Korean O
territory O
as O
the O
entire O
Korean O
peninsula O
and O
its O
adjacent O
islands O
, O
with O
'' O
North O
Korea O
'' O
being O
a O
part O
of O

Korea O
also O
claims O

of O

country O
's O
claim O
of O
sovereignty O
and O
refusal O
to O
acknowledge O
the O
other O
as O
a O
legitimate O
state O
creates O
the O
condition O
for O
perpetual O
conflict O
. O
 
North O
Korea O
's O
negative O
sentiment O
towards O
the O
U.S. O
stems O
from O
two O
major O
factors O
: O
the O
U.S. O
– O
South O
Korea O
military O
alliance O
and O
North O
Korea O
's O
perception O
that O
the O
U.S. O
is O
imperialistic O
and O
prone O
to O
exploitative O
capitalism O
. O
 
In O
recent O
years O
, O
two O
primary O
factors O
have O
heavily O
influenced O
the O
current O
state O
of O
North O
Korea's O
relations O
with O
South O
Korea O
and O
her O
allies O
: O
the O
rise O
of O
the O
regime O
's O
leader O
Kim O
Jong O
Un O
and O
the O
inauguration O
of O
South O
Korean O
president O
Park O
Guen O
Hye O
. O
 
Kim O
Jong O
Un O
officially O
rose O
to O
power O
in O
April O
2012 O
, O
following O
the O
death O
of O
his O
father O
Kim O
Jong O
Il O
in O
December O
2011 O
. O
 
While O
his O
age O
remained O
a O
mystery O
for O
quite O
some O
time O
, O
it O
was O
later O
revealed O
that O
he O
was O
born O
in O
January O
1983 O
, O
making O
him O
age O
31 O
at O
present O
. O
 
This O
makes O
Kim O
Jong O
Un O
the O
world O
's O
youngest O
leader O
of O
an O
established O
nation O
. O
 
The O
young O
leader O
's O
rise O
to O
power O
brought O
about O
several O
changes O
in O
North O
Korea O
. O
 
First O
, O
Kim O
Jong O
Un O
's O
personal O
life O
is O
more O
public O
and O
more O
extravagant O
than O
that O
of O
his O
father O
. O
 
Unlike O
his O
father O
, O
the O
young O
Kim O
is O
often O
accompanied O
by O
his O
wife O
when O
making O
public O
appearances O
. O
 
Second O
, O
the O
young O
Kim O
, O
who O
is O
more O
high-tech O
than O
his O
predecessor O
, O
is O
reported O
to O
have O
an O
affinity O
for O
luxury O
items O
and O
is O
an O
avid O
gamer O
and O
basketball O
fan O
. O
 
Third O
, O
Kim O
Jong O
Un O
is O
more O
totalitarian O
than O
his O
father O
. O
 
Following O
his O
rise O
to O
power O
, O
the O
regime O
reportedly O
expanded O
its O
labor O
camps O
, O
and O
more O
military O
resources O
were O
allocated O
to O
target O
those O
attempting O
to O
defect O
. O
 
Kim O
also O
executed O
his O
own O
uncle O
, O
a O
high-ranking O
official O
who O
did O
not O
share O
his O
ideals O
. O
 
These O
moves O
indicate O
the O
regime O
's O
priority O
to O
deter O
internal O
destabilization O
and O
dissent O
, O
which O
is O
perceived O
to O
be O
a O
greater O
threat O
than O
outside O
adversity O
. O
 
According O
to O
Phil O
Robertson O
, O
deputy O
Asia O
director O
at O
Human O
Rights O
Watch O
, O
'' O
The O
government O
now O
recognizes O
that O
the O
accounts O
of O
escaping O
North O
Koreans O
reveal O
Pyongyang O
's O
crimes O
– O
so O
it O
is O
doing O
what O
it O
can O
to O
stop O
people O
from O
fleeing O
. O
 
'' O
Under O
Kim O
Jong O
Un O
's O
rule O
, O
the O
regime O
has O
stepped O
up O
its O
nuclear O
materials O
production O
, O
and O
the O
propaganda O
distributed O
by O
state O
media O
has O
become O
more O
menacing O
. O
 
The O
regime O
's O
response O
to O
perceived O
threats O
has O
also O
become O
more O
volatile O
. O
 
Christian O
Whiton O
, O
a O
former O
deputy O
envoy O
to O
North O
Korea O
, O
noted O
that O
following O
Kim O
Jong O
Un O
's O
rise O
to O
power O
, O
'' O
the O
regime O
still O
acts O
in O
a O
very O
belligerent O
manner O
, O
but O
it O
seems O
less O
predictable O
, O
and O
more O
random O
. O

the O
situation O
thusly O
: O
'' O
Since O

took O

he O
has O
purged O
almost O
all O

why O
the O

more O
dangerous O
than O
before O
. O
 
'' O
The O
regime's O
recent O
reaction O
to O
an O
upcoming O
film O
supports O
these O
statements O

The O
plot O
for O

The O
regime O
even O
sent O
a O
complaint O
about O
the O
movie O
to O
the O
UN O
. O
 
In O
response O
to O
the O
film O
, O
a O
North O

official O
stated O
, O
'' O

referred O
to O
the O

'' O
The O

also O
issued O
a O

: O
'' O
If O
the O
U.S. O
administration O
connives O
at O
and O
patronizes O
the O

of O
the O

, O
it O
will O
invite O

According O

Kim O
Heung-kwang O
, O
a O
North O
Korean O
defector O

, O
the O
regime O
has O
the O
following O
motivations O
for O
expanding O
its O
cyber O
warfare O
capabilities O
: O
 O
Cyber O
capabilities O
are O
a O
cost-effective O
way O
to O
offset O
North O
Korea O

lack O
of O
kinetic O

cyber O
capabilities O
are O
potentially O
more O
utilitarian O
than O
heavy O
artillery O

 O
Cyber O
warfare O
capabilities O
provide O
a O
platform O
for O
espionage O
, O
psychological O

other O
forms O
of O

 O
Considering O
the O
separatist O
nature O
of O
North O
Korea O

cyber O

provides O
a O

2013 O
, O
South O
Korean O
officials O
released O
information O
stating O
they O
had O
found O
evidence O
that O
North O
Korea O
was O
using O
games O
as O
a O
medium O
for O
infecting O
machines O
and O
launching O
cyber O
attacks O
. O
 
North O
Korea O
had O
used O
game O
downloads O
to O
infect O
100,000 O
South O
Korean O
machines O
for O
a O
botnet O
used O
to O
launch O
a O
distributed O
denial O
of O
service O
( O
DDoS O
) O
attack O
against O
Incheon O

. O
 
This O
clever O
tactic O
sought O
to O
leverage O
a O
seemingly O
innocent O
game O
as O
a O
force O

to O
amplify O
the O

As O
noted O
in O

'' O
It O

the O
survival O

'' O
Historically O
, O

has O
a O

In O
April O
2013 O
, O
Solutionary O

This O
is O
an O

remain O
an O
enigma O
. O
 
Additionally O
, O
in O
line O
with O
its O
PSYOP O
tactics O
, O
North O

take O
credit O

simply O
takes O
credit O

an O

that O

not O

several O
PSYOP O
goals O
can O
come O
into O

First O
, O
to O
claim O
credit O
for O
an O
attack O
amplifies O
the O
impact O
of O
a O
show O
of O
force O
, O
particularly O
if O
South O
Korea O
is O
the O
target O
. O
 
This O
tactic O
can O
be O
used O
to O
stir O
sentiments O
in O
order O
to O
provoke O
a O
reaction O
. O
 
Second O
, O
North O
Korea O
may O
lay O
claim O
to O
responsibility O
for O
an O
attack O
that O
exceeds O
its O
capabilities O
in O
order O
to O
seem O
more O
technologically O
advanced O
and O
more O
capable O
. O
 
Third O
, O
any O
success O
, O
or O
the O
appearance O
thereof O
, O
enforces O
the O
juche O
ideal O
of O
regime O
self-sufficiency O
. O
 
Finally O
, O
North O
Korea O
may O
act O
as O
a O
scapegoat O
and O
claim O
credit O
for O
a O
cyber O
attack O
of O
an O
ally O
such O
as O
China O
so O
the O
attack O
is O
not O
attributed O
to O
the O
real O
actors O

the O
electronic O

a O
primary O

North O
Korea O
is O
economically O
dependent O

gets O
an O

90 O

This O
relationship O
is O
prudent O
– O
in O
the O
event O
of O

, O
China O
can O
strategically O
use O

While O
there O
are O
several O
variants O
of O
the O
wiper O
, O
all O
seem O
to O
have O
been O
used O
on O
the O

date O

It O
is O
unclear O
why O
multiple O
wiper O
variants O
with O
slightly O
differing O
behavior O

used O
for O
the O

One O
possible O
explanation O
is O
that O
multiple O

used O
to O
minimize O
the O
operational O
damage O
to O
the O
mission O
in O
the O
case O
of O
an O
early O

of O
one O
of O
the O
variants O

For O
example O
, O
if O
one O
wiper O
variant O
was O
compromised O
or O
detected O
by O
antivirus O

IDS O

, O
the O
other O
variants O
may O
have O
differed O
enough O
to O
remain O

success O

whether O

Based O
on O
the O
information O
above O
, O
we O
have O
identified O
strategic O
challenges O
that O
impact O
the O
development O
of O
North O
Korea O
's O
cyber O
warfare O
capabilities O
. O
 
We O
have O
also O
noted O
relevant O
implications O
: O
• O
The O
North O
Korean O
regime O
strictly O
controls O
all O
Internet O
infrastructure O
, O
meaning O
cyber O
activity O
by O
dissidents O
or O
autonomous O
hacker O
groups O
are O
very O
unlikely O
. O
 
In O
other O
words O
, O
any O
cyber O
attacks O
originating O
in O
North O
Korea O
can O
be O
assumed O
to O
be O
state O
sponsored O
. O
 
For O
this O
reason O
, O
according O
to O
defectors O
, O
the O
regime O
's O
cyber O
operators O
do O
not O
typically O
launch O
attacks O
directly O
from O
within O
North O
Korea O
. O
 
Instead O
, O
many O
regime-sponsored O
attacks O
are O
launched O
from O
cells O
based O
in O
China O
, O
U.S. O
, O
South O
Asia O
, O
Europe O
, O
and O
even O
South O
Korea O
. O
 
• O
North O
Korea O
has O
a O
limited O
number O
of O
outgoing O
connections O
. O
 
For O
this O
reason O
, O
there O
is O
a O
low O
probability O
of O
DDoS O
originating O
from O
within O
. O
 
However O
, O
this O
does O
not O
preclude O
the O
use O
of O
botnets O
with O
a O
local O
C2 O
server O
or O
the O
use O
of O
networks O
in O
third-party O
nations O
to O
launch O
attacks O
. O
 
As O
seen O
in O
the O
July O
2009 O
attacks O
on O
South O
Korean O
and O
U.S. O
targets O
, O
North O
Korea O
has O
leveraged O
networks O
in O
countries O
such O
as O
Austria O
, O
Georgia O
, O
Germany O
, O
and O
even O
South O
Korea O
and O
the O
U.S. O
, O
in O
order O
to O
launch O
cyber O
attacks O
. O
 
North O
Korea O
will O
likely O
be O
forced O
to O
rely O
on O
third O
parties O
for O
quite O
some O
time O
, O
due O
to O
its O
lack O
of O
sufficient O
infrastructure O
for O
launching O
large-scale O
CNO O
. O
 
• O
Several O
outward O
facing O
websites O
are O
hosted O
in O
China O
and O
other O
countries O
. O
 
This O
implies O
two O
possibilities O
: O
that O
North O
Korea O
's O
infrastructure O
can O
not O
handle O
a O
heavy O
incoming O
traffic O
load O
or O
that O
the O
regime O
wants O
to O
separate O
the O
propaganda O
crafted O
for O
an O
outside O
target O
audience O
from O
internally-focused O
propaganda O
. O
 
This O
arrangement O
seems O
unlikely O
to O
change O
in O
the O
foreseeable O
future O
. O
 
• O
North O
Korea O
is O
known O
to O
have O
unstable O
power O
supplies O
, O
which O
limits O
scalability O
of O
the O
regime O
's O
current O
CNO O
capabilities O
. O
 
This O
is O
another O
reason O
why O
expansion O
of O
CNO O
capabilities O
using O
the O
nation O
's O
own O
infrastructure O
seems O
unlikely O
in O
the O
foreseeable O
future O
. O
 
• O
North O
Korea O
is O
known O
to O
have O
monetary O
deficiencies O
, O
which O
further O
limit O
expansion O
of O
infrastructure O
and O
CNO O
capabilities O
, O
at O
least O
without O
third-party O
aid O
. O
 
North O
Korea O
continues O
to O
rely O
heavily O
on O
China O
for O
sustainment O
. O
 
• O
Although O
we O
see O
few O
instances O
of O
overt O
cyber O
operations O
, O
that O
North O
Korea O
reportedly O
spends O
so O
much O
of O
its O
limited O
resources O
on O
training O
and O
equipping O
cyber O
operators O
speaks O
volumes O
. O
 
The O
human O
element O
of O
the O
regime O
's O
cyber O
war O
program O
, O
at O
least O
, O
has O
potential O
. O
 
• O
Sanctions O
against O
North O
Korea O
and O
export O
laws O
prohibit O
the O
sale O
of O
certain O
technologies O
to O
the O
regime O
. O
 
In O
other O
words O
, O
in O
order O
to O
obtain O
the O
technology O
needed O
for O
a O
cyber O
warfare O
program O
, O
the O
regime O
must O
improvise O
. O
 
North O
Korea O
must O
develop O
its O
own O
technology O
, O
manufacture O
technology O
using O
plans O
obtained O
via O
industrial O
espionage O
, O
or O
rely O
on O
third O
parties O
to O
procure O
it O
for O
them O
. O
 
However O
, O
the O
regime O
has O
historically O
failed O
in O
its O
attempts O
of O
large-scale O
production O
of O
electronic O
components O
. O
 
At O
present O
, O
North O
Korea O
relies O
on O
China O
to O
provide O
much O
of O
its O
network O
hardware O
, O
including O
servers O
and O
routers O
. O
 
It O
is O
unlikely O
that O
North O
Korea O
will O
compromise O
on O
its O
nuclear O
program O
, O
meaning O
sanctions O
will O
likely O
be O
longstanding O
, O
and O
the O
regime O
will O
have O
to O
continue O
to O
rely O
on O
third O
parties O
to O
procure O
technology O
. O
 
Cyber O
incidents O
attributed O
to O
North O
Korean O
actors O
seem O
to O
follow O
distinct O
patterns O
: O
 O
According O
to O
reports O
by O
other O
researchers O
, O
the O
conventions O
and O
C2 O
structure O
used O
by O
North O
Korean O
cyber O
actors O
show O
continuity O
and O
consistency O
over O
time O
. O
 
 O
The O
majority O
of O
the O
incidents O
attributed O
to O
North O
Korean O
actors O
consistently O
used O
wiper O
malware O
. O
 
 O
Several O
of O
the O
incidents O
included O
defacements O
, O
with O
a O
different O
group O
taking O
credit O
each O
time O
. O
 
Additionally O
, O
little O
information O
or O
attack O
history O
was O
found O
about O
any O
of O
the O
groups O
, O
aside O
from O
information O
acknowledged O
in O
this O
report O
. O
 
These O
factors O
seem O
to O
indicate O
that O
a O
single O
group O
may O
have O
been O
responsible O
for O
several O
attacks O
over O
time O
, O
using O
different O
group O
names O
as O
a O
false O
flag O
. O
 
 O
On O
more O
than O
one O
occasion O
, O
the O
malware O
included O
provisions O
to O
disable O
security O
software O
made O
by O
South O
Korean O
security O
company O
AhnLab O
. O
 
This O
detail O
strengthens O
the O
case O
that O
the O
malware O
was O
written O
or O
modified O
to O
specifically O
target O
South O
Korean O
machines O
. O
 
 O
The O
attacks O
followed O
an O
explicit O
pattern O
: O
most O
were O
around O
the O
time O
of O
U.S. O
– O
South O
Korean O
joint O
military O
exercises O
, O
while O
the O
others O
fell O
on O
a O
significant O
date O
or O
were O
in O
response O
to O
political O
events O
. O
 
 O
The O
primary O
targets O
were O
South O
Korean O
and O
U.S. O
entities O
. O
 
While O
these O
nations O
are O
traditionally O
targeted O
by O
the O
regime O
, O
it O
is O
also O
possible O
that O
South O
Korean O
entities O
are O
quick O
to O
attribute O
any O
attack O
on O
their O
infrastructure O
to O
North O
Korean O
actors O
. O
 
In O
fact O
, O
in O
some O
cases O
, O
South O
Korean O
reports O
were O
the O
only O
source O
of O
attribution O
. O
 
Does O
North O
Korea O
have O
sufficient O
cyber O
infrastructure O
and O
cyber O
warfare O
capabilities O
to O
harm O
the O
U.S. O
and O
its O
allies O
? O
While O
North O
Korea O
's O
cyber O
warfare O
capabilities O
pale O
in O
comparison O
to O
those O
of O
wealthier O
nations O
, O
the O
regime O
has O
made O
significant O
progress O
in O
developing O
its O
infrastructure O
and O
in O
establishing O
cyber O
operations O
. O
 
The O
rate O
of O
this O
progress O
warrants O
a O
closer O
look O
at O
North O
Korea's O
motivations O
, O
TTPs O
, O
and O
capabilities O
. O
 
As O
noted O
above O
, O
North O
Korea O
views O
the O
U.S. O
and O
South O
Korea O
as O
its O
primary O
adversaries O
. O
 
The O
U.S. O
and O
South O
Korea O
are O
high-tech O
nations O
with O
economies O
that O
depend O
heavily O
on O
technology O
. O
 
In O
contrast O
, O
North O
Korea O
does O
not O
have O
a O
high O
tech O
culture O
. O
 
For O
these O
reasons O
, O
we O
should O
not O
overestimate O
the O
regime O
's O
advanced O
cyber O
capability O
, O
yet O
we O
should O
never O
underestimate O
the O
potential O
impact O
of O
North O
Korea O
utilizing O
less O
advanced O
, O
quick-and-dirty O
tactics O
like O
DDoS O
to O
cripple O
their O
high-tech O
targets O
. O
 
Both O
government O
and O
corporate O
entities O
are O
susceptible O
to O
being O
targeted O
by O
North O
Korean O
cyber O
attacks O
. O
 
North O
Korean O
juche O
ideology O
places O
the O
survival O
of O
the O
regime O
as O
its O
primary O
goal O
, O
and O
any O
perceived O
threat O
to O
the O
regime O
may O
be O
targeted O
. O
 
Several O
attacks O
on O
U.S. O
and O
South O
Korean O
government O
, O
financial O
, O
and O
critical O
infrastructure O
entities O
have O
been O
attributed O
to O
North O
Korean O
origins.. O
These O
attacks O
were O
often O
preceded O
by O
or O
occurred O
in O
conjunction O
with O
North O
Korea O
voicing O
negative O
sentiments O
about O
the O
targeted O
entities O
. O
 
As O
we O
saw O
with O
Iranian O
cyber O
actors O
in O
HPSR O
Security O
Briefing O
Episode O
11 O
, O
state O
sponsored O
cyber O
actors O
often O
launch O
an O
attack O
in O
response O
to O
a O
political O
trigger O
. O
 
The O
same O
pattern O
seems O
to O
apply O
to O
pro-North O
Korean O
cyber O
actors O
, O
who O
have O
launched O
attacks O
to O
coincide O
with O
U.S O
. O
 
Independence O
Day O
and O
the O
anniversary O
of O
the O
start O
of O
the O
Korean O
War O
, O
as O
well O
as O
propaganda O
and O
cyber O
attacks O
in O
response O
to O
joint O
military O
exercises O
between O
the O
U.S. O
and O
South O
Korea O
. O
 
As O
shown O
by O
North O
Korea O
's O
past O
behavior O
( O
which O
is O
consistent O
with O
their O
doctrine O
) O
, O
they O
are O
easily O
'' O
pushed O
into O
a O
corner O
'' O
. O
 
At O
the O
slightest O
perceived O
threat O
, O
the O
regime O
responds O
with O
saber-rattling O
and O
peacocking O
. O
 
The O
regime O
is O
extremely O
defensive O
and O
will O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
flex O
its O
muscles O
to O
show O
the O
world O
how O
capable O
it O
is O
, O
even O
if O
this O
is O
an O
inaccurate O
display O
of O
their O
overall O
capabilities O
. O
 
The O
regime O
fears O
losing O
its O
control O
and O
the O
nation O
's O
culture O
to O
the O
ever-growing O
threat O
of O
outside O
influence O
, O
as O
is O
evidenced O
in O
the O
regime O
's O
reaction O
to O
the O
comedy O
film O
'' O
The O
Interview O
'' O
. O
 
The O
regime O
has O
represented O
itself O
to O
its O
citizens O
as O
a O
powerful O
and O
capable O
entity O
and O
has O
used O
this O
status O
to O
control O
the O
populace O
. O
 
For O
this O
reason O
, O
the O
regime O
's O
leaders O
are O
forced O
to O
continually O
demonstrate O
this O
strength O
and O
power O
, O
or O
an O
illusion O
thereof O
, O
both O
domestically O
and O
globally O
, O
in O
order O
to O
maintain O
the O
status O
needed O
to O
ensure O
continued O
suppression O
of O
the O
population O
. O
 
This O
show O
of O
power O
may O
require O
that O
the O
regime O
takes O
chances O
and O
stretches O
beyond O
its O
abilities O
at O
times O
, O
but O
in O
the O
spirit O
of O
juche O
and O
songun O
, O
the O
regime O
will O
continue O
this O
façade O
, O
fearful O
of O
losing O
the O
image O
its O
leaders O
have O
worked O
so O
hard O
to O
maintain O
. O
 
North O
Korean O
cyber O
operations O
are O
not O
generally O
observed O
originating O
from O
home O
field O
IP O
address O
space O
, O
so O
geo-IP O
based O
blocking O
of O
traffic O
originating O
from O
those O
net-blocks O
is O
ineffective O
. O
 
Given O
that O
North O
Korea O
has O
capable O
and O
technically O
trained O
forces O
and O
will O
demonstrate O
their O
power O
when O
they O
feel O
provoked O
, O
western O
entities O
should O
consciously O
avoid O
promoting O
ideas O
or O
doctrine O
that O
is O
blatantly O
slanderous O
to O
the O
regime O
. O
 
Encouraging O
such O
ideas O
could O
cause O
those O
entities O
to O
become O
a O
focal O
point O
for O
North O
Korean O
cyber O
attacks O
. O
 
Due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
North O
Korean O
infrastructure O
is O
aging O
and O
its O
resources O
are O
not O
able O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
the O

R O

- O
especially O
military O
in O

– O
could O
become O

of O
interest O
for O
North O
Korea O
. O
 
Interest O
in O
defense-related O
IP O

could O
also O
stem O
from O
North O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
North O

, O
if O

would O
adopt O
the O
