both O

vulnerabilities O

Aggressive B-Entity

By O
leveraging O
all O
these O

an B-Entity

conduct B-Action

which O
we O

In O

explain O
the O

from O
such O

, O
in O
which O
an B-Entity

can O
intercept B-Action

When O

exploits O

, O
such O
as O
Javascript-binding-over-HTTP O
or O
dynamic- O
loading-over-HTTP O
, O
etc O
. O
 
It O
is O
a O
well-known O
challenge O
for O
an O
attacker O
to O
call O
Android O
services O
from O
injected O
native O
code O
that O
does O
n't O
have O
Android O
application O
context O

Here O
, O
we O
explain O
how O
attackers B-Entity
can O
invoke B-Action
Android B-Entity
services I-Entity
for B-Modifier
tasks O
including O
taking B-Entity
photos I-Entity
, O
calling B-Entity

, O
sending B-Entity

, O
reading B-Entity

the I-Entity

, O
etc O
. O
 
Furthermore O
, O
the B-Entity
attackers I-Entity
can O
exploit B-Action
several B-Entity
Android I-Entity
vulnerabilities I-Entity
to B-Modifier
get B-Entity
valuable I-Entity
private I-Entity
information I-Entity
or O
to B-Modifier
launch B-Entity
more I-Entity
advanced I-Entity
attacks I-Entity
. O
 
Finally O
, O
we O
show O
that O
this O
threat O
is O
not O
only O
real O
but O
also O
prevalent O
due O
to O
the O
popularity O
of O
Android O
ad O
libraries O
. O
 
We O
hope O
this O
paper O
kickstarts O
the O
conversation O
on O
how O
to O
better O
protect O

and O
how O
to O
further O
harden O
the O

in O
the O
future O

To O
understand O
the O

brought O
by O

, O
we O
first O
explain O
one O
possible O

mechanism O
( O

that O
is O
similar O
to O
that O

The B-Entity
attacker I-Entity
can O
hijack B-Action
the B-Entity
network I-Entity
where I-Entity
the I-Entity
targeted I-Entity
victim I-Entity
resides I-Entity
. O
 
Like O
an O
infrared O

, O
the O
attacker O
then O
seeks O
'' O
emission O
'' O
from O
ad O
libraries O
running O
on O
the O
target O
device O
to O
track O
and O
lock O
on O
it O
. O
 
Once O
the O
target O
is O
locked O
on O
, O
the O
attacker O
can O
launch O
advanced O
persistent O
attacks O
. O
 
To O
minimize O
detection O
chances O
, O
the B-Entity
attacker I-Entity
can O
choose B-Action

take B-Entity
action I-Entity
on I-Entity
important I-Entity

only I-Entity
, O
ignoring O
all O

how O
a B-Entity

can O
launch B-Action

precise I-Entity

. O
 
Table O

First O
we O
need O
to O

For O
example O

we O
encourage O

to O
use O
HTTPS O
with O
proper O
SSL O

, O
and O
to O
properly O
encrypt O

. O
 
They O
also O
need O
to O
be O
cautious O
about O
which O

exposed O
to O
the O

, O
in O

of O

attackers I-Entity
hijacking B-Action
the B-Entity
communication I-Entity

. O
 
Meanwhile O
, O
Google O
itself O
needs O
to O
further O
harden O
the O
security O
framework O
. O
 
This O
may O
prove O
difficult O
because O
: O

. O
 
Android O
is O
a O
complex O
system O
. O
 
Any O
sub- O
component O

may O
impact O
the O

of O
the O
whole O

the O
situation O
even O
more O
challenging O

. O
 
The O
trade-off O
between O
usability O
, O
performance O
and O
security O
always O
matters O
, O
and O
market O
demand O
frequently O
dictates O
that O
security O
comes O
last O
. O
 
Many O
Android O
developers O
do O
not O
even O
understand O
how O
to O
program O
securely O
( O
as O
shown O
in O

) O

Many O
security O
patches O
are O
not O
back-ported O

old O
versions O

( O

) O
, O
even O
though O
older O

are O
widely O
used O

. O
 
There O
is O
always O
information O
asymmetry O
in O
the O
development O
chain O
. O
 
For O
example O
, O
it O
usually O
takes O
several O
months O
for O
vendors O
to O
apply O
security O
patches O
after O
Google O
releases O
them O
. O
 
Albeit O
challenging O
, O
we O
hope O
that O
this O
work O
can O
kickstart O
a O
conversation O
, O
both O
on O
improved O
security O
and O
privacy O
protection O
in O
third-party O
libraries O
and O
on O
a O
