The O
energy O
sector O
has O
become O
a O
major O
focus O
for O
targeted O
attacks O
and O
is O
now O
among O
the O
top O
five O
most O
targeted O
sectors O
worldwide O
. O
 
Companies O
in O
the O
sector O
are O
facing O
a O
growing O
risk O
of O
having O
their O
services O
interrupted O
or O
losing O
data O
. O
 
The O
threat O
to O
energy O
firms O
is O
only O
likely O
to O
increase O
in O
the O
coming O
years O
as O
new O
developments O
, O
such O
as O
further O
extensions O
of O
smart O
grids O
and O
smart O
metering O
expose O
more O
infrastructure O
to O
the O
Internet O
. O
 
Equipment O
that O
is O
not O
connected O
to O
the O
Internet O
and O
other O
networks O
is O
not O
immune O
to O
threats O
and O
there O
has O
already O
been O
a O
number O
of O
successful O
attacks O
against O
isolated O
systems O
. O
 
Operators O
of O
critical O
infrastructure O
, O
as O
well O
as O
energy O
utility O
companies O
, O
need O
to O
be O
aware O
of O
these O
threats O
and O
prepare O
accordingly O
. O
 
The O
threat O
to O
energy O
firms O
comes O
from O
several O
different O
sources O
. O
 
In O
some O
cases O
, O
espionage O
from O
competitors O
is O
the O
primary O
motive O
, O
with O
data O
on O
new O
projects O
, O
exploration O
and O
finances O
being O
targeted O
. O
 
Disruption O
and O
destruction O
are O
the O
goals O
of O
other O
attacks O
. O
 
Some O
instances O
appear O
to O
be O
state O
sponsored O
, O
such O
as O
the O
disruption O
of O
the O
Iranian O
nuclear O
program O
by O
the O
Stuxnet O
worm O
in O
2010 O
, O
one O
of O
the O
attacks O
that O
began O
this O
trend O
. O
 
Others O
appear O
to O
be O
the O
work O
of O
hacktivists O
with O
political O
or O
environmental O
agendas O
. O
 
Internal O
attackers O
, O
like O
disgruntled O
employees O
, O
are O
also O
a O
major O
source O
of O
attacks O
that O
often O
lead O
to O
service O
disruption O
. O
 
The O
majority O
of O
the O
actors O
behind O
these O
attacks O
have O
grown O
more O
sophisticated O
in O
the O
way O
they O
attack O
. O
 
During O
the O
monitoring O
period O
from O
July O
2012 O
to O
June O
2013 O
, O
we O
observed O
an O
average O
of O
74 O
targeted O
attacks O
per O
day O
globally O
. O
 
Of O
these O
, O
nine O
attacks O
per O
day O
targeted O
the O
energy O
sector O
. O
 
Accounting O
for O
16.3 O
percent O
of O
all O
attacks O
, O
the O
energy O
sector O
was O
the O
second O
most O
targeted O
vertical O
in O
the O
last O
six O
months O
of O
2012 O
, O
with O
only O
the O
government/public O
sector O
exceeding O
it O
with O
25.4 O
percent O
of O
all O
attacks O
. O
 
The O
high O
ranking O
was O
mainly O
due O
to O
a O
major O
attack O
against O
a O
global O
oil O
company O
, O
which O
we O
observed O
in O
September O
2012 O
. O
 
However O
, O
in O
the O
first O
half O
of O
2013 O
the O
energy O
sector O
continued O
to O
attract O
a O
high O
proportion O
of O
attacks O
, O
ranking O
in O
fifth O
place O
with O
7.6 O
percent O
of O
targeted O
attacks O
. O
 
Not O
all O
of O
the O
attacks O
analyzed O
used O
highly O
sophisticated O
tools O
. O
 
Most O
of O
them O
could O
have O
been O
prevented O
by O
following O
best O
practice O
guidelines O
for O
protecting O
the O
IT O
infrastructure O
and O
the O
industrial O
components O
, O
indicating O
that O
despite O
high O
revenues O
and O
strategic O
importance O
, O
many O
energy O
sector O
companies O
are O
not O
prioritizing O
cybersecurity O
. O
 
The O
number O
of O
targeted O
cyberattacks O
in O
general O
has O
risen O
in O
the O
past O
few O
years O
. O
 
In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
the O
rate O
of O
attack O
exposure O
has O
also O
risen O
, O
with O
more O
companies O
becoming O
aware O
of O
attacks O
, O
expecting O
them O
and O
searching O
for O
indications O
of O
compromise O
. O
 
It O
is O
not O
a O
new O
phenomenon O
, O
but O
its O
importance O
has O
grown O
. O
 
The O
Council O
on O
Foreign O
Relations O
, O
a O
US O
think O
tank O
, O
reported O
that O
energy O
companies O
, O
including O
oil O
and O
gas O
producers O
, O
were O
often O
the O
focus O
of O
targeted O
attacks O
during O
summer O
2012 O
. O
 
In O
May O
2013 O
the O
US O
Department O
of O
Homeland O
Security O
( O
DHS O
) O
warned O
of O
an O
increase O
in O
sabotage O
attacks O
against O
US O
energy O
companies O
located O
in O
the O
Middle O
East O
. O
 
The O
government O
had O
tracked O
multiple O
attacks O
and O
issued O
a O
warning O
together O
with O
the O
Industrial O
Control O
Systems O
Cyber O
Emergency O
Response O
Team O
( O
ICS-CERT O
) O
. O
 
A O
report O
by O
the O
US O
Congress O
supported O
this O
picture O
, O
stating O
that O
many O
power O
utilities O
companies O
were O
under O
constant O
or O
daily O
attack O
through O
cyberspace O
. O
 
Taking O
into O
account O
that O
successful O
breaches O
of O
critical O
infrastructures O
are O
still O
rare O
and O
that O
these O
numbers O
included O
generic O
malware O
infections O
, O
it O
nevertheless O
highlights O
the O
potential O
for O
cyberattacks O
in O
the O
energy O
sector O
. O
 
As O
in O
most O
sectors O
, O
attackers O
are O
often O
after O
valuable O
information O
. O
 
For O
example O
, O
we O
have O
seen O
attackers O
target O
intellectual O
property O
such O
as O
technology O
for O
photovoltaic O
research O
and O
wind O
turbines O
, O
or O
data O
on O
gas O
field O
exploration O
. O
 
Information O
such O
as O
this O
is O
of O
high O
value O
and O
can O
generate O
huge O
profits O
for O
attackers O
or O
their O
sponsors O
. O
 
The O
same O
information O
can O
also O
be O
misused O
for O
an O
act O
of O
sabotage O
. O
 
Many O
power O
utilities O
companies O
fear O
disruptive O
attacks O
the O
most O
, O
regardless O
of O
whether O
it O
is O
done O
by O
internal O
or O
external O
attackers O
. O
 
The O
energy O
sector O
has O
a O
high O
potential O
for O
critical O
disruption O
through O
sabotage O
attacks O
. O
 
Any O
interruption O
to O
the O
power O
grid O
would O
cause O
substantial O
chaos O
and O
cascading O
effects O
resulting O
in O
financial O
loss O
. O
 
In O
the O
past O
there O
have O
been O
quite O
a O
few O
attacks O
that O
included O
targets O
in O
the O
energy O
sector O
. O
 
Some O
of O
these O
were O
more O
focused O
, O
like O
Stuxnet O
, O
Duqu O
, O
Shamoon/Disttrack O
and O
Night O
Dragon O
. O
 
Others O
saw O
power O
companies O
targeted O
among O
many O
other O
sectors O
, O
such O
as O
Hidden O
Lynx O
, O
Nitro O
, O
Flamer O
, O
Net O
Traveler O
and O
Elderwood O
to O
name O
a O
few O
. O
 
One O
of O
the O
biggest O
examples O
, O
and O
a O
game O
changer O
for O
many O
organizations O
, O
was O
Stuxnet O
. O
 
This O
targeted O
sabotage O
attack O
, O
which O
is O
believed O
to O
have O
been O
aimed O
against O
uranium O
enrichment O
facilities O
in O
Iran O
, O
made O
clear O
what O
could O
be O
done O
through O
cyberattacks O
. O
 
It O
is O
also O
clear O
that O
the O
energy O
sector O
is O
not O
exempt O
from O
the O
generic O
attacks O
that O
every O
company O
faces O
, O
such O
as O
ransomware B-Entity
that O
locks B-Action
PCs B-Entity
or O
financial B-Entity
Trojans I-Entity
that O
attempt O
to O
steal B-Action
passwords B-Entity
and I-Entity
credit I-Entity
card I-Entity
details I-Entity
. O
 
For O
example O
, O
such O
a O
case O
happened O
in O
May O
2013 O
, O
when O
a O
small O
fuel O
distribution O
company O
in O
North O
Carolina O
fell O
victim O
to O
a O
cyberheist O
that O
transferred O
US O
$ O
800,000 O
from O
the O
company O
's O
bank O
account O
. O
 
Such O
threats O
spread O
broadly O
and O
might O
impact O
any O
person O
, O
regardless O
of O
their O
employer O
. O
 
These O
attackers O
aim O
at O
infecting O
as O
many O
computers O
as O
possible O
in O
order O
to O
maximize O
their O
chances O
of O
profits O
. O
 
These O
attacks O
can O
include O
nonspecific O
data O
breaches O
where O
employee B-Entity
or I-Entity
customer I-Entity
records I-Entity
get O
stolen B-Action
, O
as O
happened O
to O
the O
US O
Department O
of O
Energy O
in O
July O
2013 O
. O
 
For O
this O
paper O
we O
focused O
on O
email O
data O
from O
targeted O
attacks O
between O
July O
2012 O
and O
June O
2013 O
. O
 
Even O
though O
watering O
holes O
are O
becoming O
more O
frequently O
used O
in O
targeted O
attacks O
, O
it O
is O
unfortunately O
quite O
difficult O
to O
reliably O
map O
these O
to O
individual O
campaigns O
. O
 
A O
blocked O
drive-by O
download O
attempt O
does O
not O
give O
any O
indication O
if O
it O
was O
a O
targeted O
attack O
or O
just O
general O
noise O
. O
 
In O
quite O
a O
few O
cases O
we O
see O
the O
same O
common O
malware O
, O
like O
Poison O
Ivy O
, O
being O
used O
by O
generic O
attackers O
and O
by O
targeted O
attacks O
. O
 
In O
such O
cases O
the O
sole O
difference O
between O
a O
sophisticated O
targeted O
attack O
and O
a O
generic O
one O
lies O
in O
the O
person O
commanding O
the O
malware O
. O
 
Historically O
most O
industrial O
control O
systems O
( O
ICS O
) O
and O
supervisory O
control O
and O
data O
acquisition O
( O
SCADA O
) O
systems O
were O
in O
separated O
networks O
not O
connected O
to O
the O
Internet O
or O
any O
other O
network O
. O
 
Unfortunately O
this O
security O
through O
segregation O
approach O
does O
not O
fully O
protect O
against O
cyberattacks O
. O
 
In O
reality O
, O
networks O
are O
rarely O
completely O
isolated O
. O
 
Often O
some O
configuration O
updates O
are O
periodically O
installed O
or O
log O
files O
are O
transferred O
. O
 
If O
systems O
are O
not O
directly O
connected O
, O
the O
method O
of O
choice O
for O
these O
types O
of O
interactions O
is O
usually O
through O
a O
USB O
stick O
or O
a O
non-permanent O
modem O
connection O
, O
which O
provides O
a O
way O
into O
the O
restricted O
networks O
. O
 
This O
allows O
malware B-Entity
to O
spread B-Action
into B-Modifier
such B-Entity
isolated I-Entity
networks I-Entity
as B-Modifier
demonstrated B-Entity
many I-Entity
times I-Entity
by I-Entity
threats I-Entity
such I-Entity
as I-Entity
Stuxnet I-Entity
. O
 
If O
networks O
are O
truly O
segregated O
, O
this O
would O
mean O
that O
there O
would O
be O
no O
software O
updates O
installed O
, O
leaving O
old O
vulnerabilities O
open O
. O
 
There O
are O
also O
issues O
around O
processes O
. O
 
For O
example O
, O
the O
revocation O
lists O
for O
digital O
certificates O
are O
seldom O
updated O
and O
therefore O
certificates O
which O
are O
no O
longer O
valid O
can O
not O
be O
checked O
properly O
and O
would O
still O
be O
accepted O
. O
 
With O
the O
increasing O
desire O
for O
connectivity O
now O
reaching O
industrial O
plants O
, O
many O
operators O
have O
started O
to O
connect O
their O
ICS O
to O
the O
Internet O
. O
 
New O
adapters O
can O
bridge O
to O
older O
technology O
which O
was O
never O
intended O
to O
be O
controlled O
over O
the O
Internet O
, O
allowing O
it O
to O
be O
connected O
easily O
. O
 
This O
allows O
for O
efficient O
centralized O
monitoring O
and O
, O
to O
some O
extent O
, O
remote O
control O
of O
equipment O
. O
 
Depending O
on O
the O
type O
of O
machinery O
controlled O
through O
the O
human-machine O
interface O
( O
HMI O
) O
of O
the O
ICS O
, O
not O
all O
modifications O
are O
possible O
. O
 
Some O
systems O
are O
physically O
connected O
in O
a O
pure O
read-only O
mode O
for O
monitoring O
. O
 
And O
even O
if O
they O
are O
fully O
connected O
, O
some O
turbines O
have O
physical O
limitations O
or O
emergency O
systems O
based O
on O
physical O
effects O
that O
can O
not O
be O
overridden O
by O
the O
digital O
controller O
. O
 
Thus O
, O
not O
all O
Hollywood O
scenarios O
of O
open O
flood O
gates O
or O
turbines O
that O
fly O
through O
the O
air O
are O
possible O
. O
 
However O
, O
sabotage B-Entity
attacks I-Entity
that O
damage B-Action
equipment B-Entity
are O
definitely O
possible O
, O
as O
has O
already O
been O
demonstrated O
. O
 
In O
the O
future O
, O
more O
systems O
are O
going O
to O
implement O
the O
failsafe O
switches O
in O
software O
, O
opening O
up O
the O
vector O
for O
malware O
attacks O
. O
 
An O
additional O
source O
of O
concern O
is O
that O
some O
countries O
have O
started O
to O
open O
the O
energy O
market O
for O
smaller O
private O
contributors O
. O
 
This O
means O
that O
almost O
anyone O
can O
use O
mini O
power O
plants O
like O
water O
, O
wind O
or O
photovoltaic O
sites O
to O
feed O
energy O
back O
into O
the O
power O
grid O
. O
 
Often O
these O
operators O
do O
not O
have O
a O
full O
IT O
staff O
supporting O
the O
facilities O
at O
hand O
, O
which O
might O
lead O
to O
more O
vulnerable O
installations O
. O
 
Furthermore O
they O
may O
deploy O
new O
technology O
which O
might O
be O
untested O
and O
contain O
some O
unknown O
vulnerabilities O
. O
 
While O
these O
smaller O
sites O
make O
up O
only O
a O
small O
portion O
of O
the O
grid O
, O
new O
decentralized O
power O
input O
feeds O
are O
a O
challenge O
for O
the O
balance O
of O
the O
power O
grid O
as O
well O
and O
need O
to O
be O
carefully O
monitored O
. O
 
Small O
outages O
or O
changes O
can O
have O
a O
domino O
effect O
for O
the O
whole O
power O
grid O
. O
 
To O
increase O
the O
exposure O
of O
energy O
firms O
even O
further O
, O
sites O
like O
SHODAN O
, O
which O
is O
essentially O
a O
search O
engine O
for O
devices O
, O
enable O
anyone O
to O
easily O
find O
exposed O
controllers O
on O
the O
Internet O
. O
 
Of O
course O
not O
all O
of O
the O
industrial O
control O
systems O
connected O
to O
the O
Internet O
are O
critical O
systems O
or O
even O
real O
ones O
. O
 
Some O
researchers O
have O
started O
to O
create O
honey O
pot O
systems O
in O
order O
to O
study O
the O
attackers O
, O
which O
have O
apparently O
already O
attracted O
attackers O
like O
the O
Comment O
Crew/APT1 O
group O
, O
who O
have O
broken O
into O
these O
decoy O
systems O
. O
 
Smart O
grids O
and O
smart O
metering O
are O
bringing O
significant O
change O
to O
the O
world O
's O
power O
systems O
. O
 
Experts O
predict O
that O
billions O
of O
smart O
meters O
and O
sensors O
will O
be O
installed O
worldwide O
over O
the O
next O
ten O
years O
. O
 
They O
enable O
utility O
companies O
to O
measure O
energy O
consumption O
at O
a O
more O
granular O
level O
, O
creating O
better O
flow O
patterns O
and O
enabling O
different O
prices O
for O
consumption O
based O
on O
the O
time O
of O
day O
and O
location O
. O
 
This O
development O
brings O
new O
opportunities O
, O
as O
well O
as O
new O
challenges O
. O
 
As O
with O
any O
connected O
infrastructure O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
secure O
the O
network O
and O
its O
endpoint O
on O
multiple O
levels O
. O
 
There O
have O
already O
been O
proof O
of O
concept O
attacks O
that O
demonstrate O
how O
smart B-Entity
meters I-Entity
could O
be B-Action
manipulated I-Action
to B-Modifier
send B-Entity
back I-Entity
false I-Entity
information I-Entity
or I-Entity
report I-Entity
incorrect I-Entity
billing I-Entity
IDs I-Entity
, I-Entity
leading I-Entity
to I-Entity
power I-Entity
theft I-Entity
. O
 
In O
addition O
to O
the O
issue O
of O
securing O
these O
devices O
, O
smart O
grids O
will O
produce O
a O
huge O
amount O
of O
data O
which O
, O
depending O
on O
regulations O
, O
will O
need O
to O
be O
kept O
for O
audits O
. O
 
Some O
of O
this O
data O
may O
be O
sensitive O
and O
could O
raise O
privacy O
concerns O
if O
not O
properly O
protected O
. O
 
This O
could O
easily O
grow O
to O
petabytes O
of O
data O
that O
needs O
to O
be O
safely O
stored O
and O
managed O
. O
 
It O
is O
beyond O
the O
scope O
of O
this O
paper O
to O
address O
all O
the O
challenges O

There O
have O
been O
numerous O
cyberattacks O
against O

over O
the O
past O
few O
years O
. O
 
Not O
all O
of O

were O
the O
work O
of O
sophisticated O

some O
incidents O
were O
just O
collateral O

highlight O
the O
fact O
that O
such O

can O
happen O
and O
that O
they O
can O
have O
real O
life O

. O
 
In O
2013 O
part O
of O
the O
Austrian O
and O
German O
power O
grid O
nearly O
broke O
down O
after O
a O

of O
the O
Austrian O
energy O

. O
 
Once O
there O
, O
the O
message O
generated O
thousands O
of O

, O
which O
generated O
even O
more O

which O
in O

To O
stop O
this O
self-inflicted O
DDoS O
attack O
, O
part O
of O
the O
monitoring O

had O
to O
be O
isolated O

Fortunately O
the O
situation O
was O
resolved O
without O
any O

In O
2008 O
, O
Tom O
Donahue O
, O
a O

In O
some O
cases O
the O

tried O
to O
extort O
money O
from O

In O

the B-Entity

Fortunately O
the O

and O
the O

Nevertheless O
the O

. O
 
At O
the O
beginning O
of O
2003 O
a B-Entity
marine I-Entity

in I-Entity
Venezuela I-Entity
was B-Action
targeted I-Action
by O
a B-Entity

. O
 
Details O
of O
this O

are O
scarce O
and O
vague O
, O
but O
it O
seems O
that O
during O
a O
strike O
an B-Entity

managed O
to O
get B-Action

the I-Entity
SCADA I-Entity

The O
attack O
was O
not O
too O
sophisticated O
as O
it O
was O
easily O
spotted O
. O
 
A O
small O
modification O
of O
the O

instead O
would O
probably O
have O
gone O
unnoticed O
for O
a O

In O
2001 O
an O
attack O
took O
place O
against O
California O
's O
power O
distribution O
center O
, O
which O
controls O
the O
flow O
of O
electricity O
across O
California O
. O
 
Due O
to O
apparently O
poor O
security O
configuration O
, O
the O
attacker O
was O
able O
to O
compromise O
two O
Web O
servers O
that O
were O
part O
of O
a O
developer O
network O
and O
penetrate O
further O
from O
there O
. O
 
Fortunately O
the O
attackers O
were O
stopped O
before O
they O
managed O
to O
attack O
any O
systems O
which O
were O
tied O
into O
the O

According O
to O
Russian O

the O
largest O

was O
successfully O
attacked O
in O
2000 O

The B-Entity
attackers I-Entity
used B-Action
a B-Entity

gain B-Entity
access I-Entity

Through O
this O

Aside O

also O
been O
a O
number O

The O
Stuxnet O

As O
far O
as O
we O
know O
today O
, O
the B-Entity
Stuxnet I-Entity
operation I-Entity
began B-Action
in B-Modifier
November B-Entity
2005 I-Entity

. O
 
The O
first O
recorded O
appearance O
of O
what O
we O
now O
call O
Stuxnet O
version O
0.5 O
was O
in O
November O
2007 O
. O
 
Since O
then O
, O
a O
handful O
of O
different O
versions O
have O
been O
found O
and O
analyzed O
. O
 
Stuxnet O
1.x O
is O
based O
on O
what O
is O
now O
known O
as O
the O
'' O
tilded O
'' O
platform O
; O
whereas O
Stuxnet O
0.5 O
is O
based O
on O
the O
Flamer O
framework O
. O
 
The O
code O
segments O
and O
programming O
style O
differ O
, O
which O
indicates O
that O
two O
different O
programming O
teams O
were O
most O
likely O
responsible O
for O
the O
different O
branches O
of O
Stuxnet O
. O
 
Thorough O
investigation O
into O
the O
mechanism O
and O
functions O
of O
this O
threat O
started O
in O
July O
2010 O
. O
 
Stuxnet B-Entity

the O
first O
known O
autonomous O

to O
such O
an O
extent O
. O
 
Stuxnet B-Entity
is O
a O

, O
which O
uses B-Action
seven B-Entity

auto-execute O
on O
USB O

. O
 
Spreading B-Action

gaps I-Entity
that I-Entity

This O
was O
most O

the O
first O

This O
minimized O
the O

, O
no O
computer O

One O
group O
that O
claimed O
responsibility O
for O
the O
attack O
posted O
on O
Pastebin O
that O
it O
was O
an O
anti-oppression O
hacker O
group O
. O
 
The O
attack O
was O
prompted O
by O

some O
of O
the O

in O
the O
Middle O
East O
, O
the O
group O

necessarily O
only O
state-sponsored O
attackers O

carrying O
out O

Sabotage O
attacks O
usually O
fall O
into O
the O
orbit O
of O
hacktivists O
, O
who O
seek O
attention O
rather O
than O

Some O

reported O
that O

which O
would O
explain O
the O
so O

infection O
vector O

Soon O
after O

one O
of O

The O
attacks O
are O
simple O
to O
carry O
out O
. O
 
They O
often O
follow O
the O
same O
pattern O
, O
starting O
with O
a O
reconnaissance O
phase O
to O
gather O
all O
publicly O
available O
information O
. O
 
This O
is O
followed O
by O
the O
incursion O
phase O
of O
breaking B-Action
in I-Action
and I-Action
compromising I-Action
computers B-Entity
. O
 
After O
that O
comes O
the O
discovery O
phase O
, O
where O
the B-Entity
attacker I-Entity
gathers B-Action
passwords B-Entity
and O
maps B-Action
the B-Entity
internal I-Entity
network I-Entity
. O
 
The O
final O
stage O
is O
capture O
and O
exfiltration O
, O
where O
the B-Entity
valuable I-Entity
information I-Entity
is B-Action
copied I-Action
and O
sent B-Action
back I-Action
to B-Modifier
the B-Entity
attacker I-Entity
. O
 
The O
last O
phase O
may O
also O
involve O
a O

many O
different O
groups O

These O
attacks O
can O
not O
be O
attributed O
to O
only O
one O
group O

We O
have O
seen O

possible O
state O
sponsored O
agents O
carrying O
out O
attacks O
against O

. O
 
Some O
of O
the O
attacks O
have O
been O
purely O
opportunistic O
, O
seeking O
any O
valuable O
information O
available O
. O
 
Other O
campaigns O
look O
like O
they O
were O
planned O
over O
a O
lengthy O
period O
and O
carried O
out O
methodically O
with O
a O
clear O
goal O
in O
mind O
. O
 
The O
attackers O
tend O
to O
go O
after O
valuable O
information O
, O
including O
maps O
of O
new O
gas O
fields O
or O
research O
on O

. O
 
This O
information O
can O
be O

great O
value O
to O
competitors O
or O
nations O
that O
want O
to O
make O
progress O
in O
the O

field O
. O
 
Another O
motivation O
for O
attackers O
is O
to O
profit O
from O
the O
information O
stolen O
by O
blackmailing O
the O
company O
. O
 
The O
same O
information O
can O
be O
used O
to O
carry O
out O
sabotage O
attacks O
designed O
to O
disrupt O
ICSs O
, O
as O
the O
energy O
sector O
is O
also O
a O
primary O
target O
for O
sabotage O
attacks O
which O
will O
not O
generate O
direct O
profit O
for O
the O

Cyberespionage O
campaigns O

are O
becoming O
increasingly O
common O

with O
countless O
threat O
actors O
attempting O
to O
gain O
a O
foothold O
in O
some O
of O
the O
best O

. O
 
At O
this O
stage O
, O
roughly O
five O
targeted O
attacks O
per O
day O
are O
being O
mounted O
on O
firms O
in O
the O
energy O
sector O
. O
 
These O
attacks O
have O
become O
increasingly O
sophisticated O
, O
although O
the O
capabilities O
and O
tactics O
used O
by O
these O
threat O
actors O
vary O
considerably O
. O
 
In O
the O
second O
half O
of O
2012 O
, O
the O
energy O
sector O
was O
the O
second O
most O
targeted O
with O
16 O
percent O
of O
all O
the O
targeted O
attacks O
. O
 
This O
strong O
increase O
was O
mainly O
due O
to O
a O
large O
scale O
attack O
against O
one O
global O
oil O
company O
. O
 
In O
the O
first O
half O
of O
2013 O
, O
the O
energy O
sector O
was O
ranked O
fifth O
with O
7.6 O
percent O
of O
all O
attacks O
focused O
on O
this O
sector O
. O
 
In O
general O
we O
have O
observed O
that O
attackers O
are O
becoming O
more O
efficient O
and O
focusing O
on O
smaller O
operations O
that O
attract O
less O
attention O
. O
 
The O
attackers O
tend O
to O
go O
after O
valuable O
information O
– O
such O
as O
maps O
of O
a O
new O
gas O
field O
– O
but O
the O
sector O
is O
also O
a O
major O
target O
for O
sabotage O
attacks O
, O
which O
will O
not O
generate O
direct O
profit O
for O
the O
attacker O
. O
 
Such O
disruptive O
attacks O
do O
already O
happen O
and O
may O
lead O
to O
large O
financial O
losses O
. O
 
State O
sponsored O
agents O
, O
competitors O
, O
internal O
attackers O
or O
hacktivists O
are O
the O
most O
likely O
authors O
of O
such O
sabotage O
attacks O
. O
 
Fortunately O
, O
there O
have O
not O
been O
many O
successful O
sabotage O
attacks O
against O
energy O
companies O
to O

. O
 
However O
, O
the O
increasing O
number O
of O
connected O
systems O
and O
centralized O
control O
for O
ICS O
systems O
means O
that O
the O
risk O
of O
attacks O
in O
the O
future O
will O
increase O
. O
 
Energy O
and O
utility O
companies O
need O
to O
be O
aware O
of O
these O
risks O
and O
plan O
accordingly O
to O
protect O
their O

message O
may O
prompt O
the O
user O
into O
opening O
an O
attachment O
. O
 
It O
is O
evident O
that O
most O
attackers O
are O
carefully O
selecting O
the O
themes O
that O
they O
use O
for O
their O
attacks O
. O
 
Some O
groups O
use O
real O

copy O
the O
text O
directly O
from O

attention O
. O
 
In O
the O
energy O

the O
most O
commonly O

The O

, O
we O
see O
a O
trend O

conducting O
more O

fewer O

, O
but O
these O
are O
the O
exception O
rather O
than O
the O
rule O
. O
 
It O
might O
be O
that O
the O

tried O
to O
bypass O
some O

This O
indicates O
that O
either O

all O

have O
the O
knowhow O
to O
use O
newer O

that O
are O
publicly O

or O
they O
speculate O
that O
the O

Some O
of O
the O
attackers O
do O
not O
seem O
to O
be O
too O
sophisticated O
. O

they O
used O

used O
to O
analyze O
the O
behavior O
of O
cybercriminals O
involved O

various O
types O
of O
Internet O
attack O
activities O
, O
such O
as O
rogue O
antivirus O

botnets O
operations O
, O
scam O
campaigns O
and O
targeted O
attacks O
performed O
via O
spear O

emails O
. O
 
As O
with O
any O
other O
targeted O
attacks O
, O
attacks O
against O
the O
energy O
sector O
often O
follow O
the O
same O
pattern O
. O
 
It O
can O
be O
broken O
down O
in O
different O
phases O
of O
attack O
. O
 
It O
should O
be O
noted O
that O
we O
have O
seen O
attackers O
modify O
their O
behavior O
and O
exceptions O
from O
the O
norm O
and O
this O
is O
possible O
especially O
if O
the O
target O
company O
has O
special O
circumstances O
or O
security O
measures O
in O
place O
. O
 
During O
this O
phase O
the O
attacker O
tries O
to O
learn O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
about O
the O
targeted O
organization O
. O
 
Information O
sources O
often O
include O
social O
networks O
, O
job O
posting O
sites O
and O
press O
releases O
. O
 
This O
enables O
the O
attacker O
to O
learn O
the O
contact O
details O
of O
possible O
target O
individuals O
as O
well O
as O
context O
that O
can O
be O
used O
in O
social O
engineering O
scenarios O
. O
 
The O
attacker O
will O
often O
create O
a O
list O
of O
implemented O
security O
software O
used O
at O
the O
targeted O
company O
from O
whatever O
information O
is O
available O
. O
 
These O
investigations O
often O
start O
completely O
passively O
without O
any O
direct O
contact O
with O
the O
company O
, O
since O
there O
are O
many O
data O
sources O
publicly O
available O
. O
 
Subsequently O
the O
attacker O
can O
use O
more O
interaction O
if O
needed O
. O
 
Some O
attackers O
go O
through O
all O
the O
effort O
of O
creating O
a O
fake O
social O
media O
account O
and O
befriending O
key O
employees O
. O
 
After O
a O
period O
of O
small O
talk O
, O
to O
create O
a O
false O
sense O
of O
security O
, O
such O
a O
connection O
can O
then O
be O
used O
to O
pass O
on O
an O
infected O
document O
or O
find O
out O
about O
some O
key O
information O
. O
 
Depending O
on O
the O
targeted O
location O
, O
physical O
reconnaissance O
and O
eavesdropping O
may O
also O
be O
used O
. O
 
The O
actual O
break-in O
occurs O
during O
this O
phase O
. O
 
The B-Entity
attacker I-Entity
usually O
compromises B-Action
the B-Entity
network I-Entity
by O
delivering B-Action
targeted B-Entity
malware I-Entity
to B-Modifier
vulnerable B-Entity
systems I-Entity
or I-Entity
employees I-Entity
. O
 
There O
are O
two O
main O
avenues O
of O
attack O
. O
 
One O
is O
to O
send B-Action
spear B-Entity
phishing I-Entity
emails I-Entity
, O
where O
a B-Entity
link I-Entity
to I-Entity
a I-Entity
malicious I-Entity
website I-Entity
or I-Entity
a I-Entity
malicious I-Entity
attachment I-Entity
is B-Action
delivered I-Action
using B-Modifier
social B-Entity
engineering I-Entity
techniques I-Entity
. O
 
The B-Entity
second I-Entity
method I-Entity
, O
which O
is O
gaining O
traction O
, O
is B-Action
watering B-Entity
hole I-Entity
attacks I-Entity
, O
where O
the B-Entity
attacker I-Entity
infects B-Action
a B-Entity
website I-Entity
that I-Entity
has I-Entity
a I-Entity
high I-Entity
likelihood I-Entity
of I-Entity
being I-Entity
visited I-Entity
by I-Entity
the I-Entity
intended I-Entity
victim I-Entity
. O
 
By O
using B-Action
IP B-Entity
address I-Entity
filters I-Entity
before B-Modifier
infecting B-Entity
any I-Entity
visitor I-Entity
of I-Entity
such I-Entity
sites I-Entity
, O
the B-Entity
attacker I-Entity
can O
reduce O
the O
number O
of O
infected O
systems O
and O
bring O
it O
to O
a O
manageable O
quantity O
which O
can O
be O
assessed O
manually O
at O
another O
time O
. O
 
Some B-Entity
groups I-Entity
carefully O
plan B-Action
watering B-Entity
hole I-Entity
attacks I-Entity
. O
 
For O
example O
the O
Hidden O
Lynx O
group O
stopped O
using O
a O
zero-day O
vulnerability O
in O
a O
large O
watering O
hole O
attack O
after O
Microsoft O
released O
details O
on O
the O
vulnerability O
. O
 
This O
helped O
to O
cover O
their O
activities O
and O
avoid O
unwanted O
attention O
. O
 
A O
few O
days O
later O
the B-Entity
group I-Entity
resumed B-Action
the B-Entity
watering I-Entity
hole I-Entity
attack I-Entity
again O
, O
this O
time O
using B-Modifier
a B-Entity
different I-Entity
exploit I-Entity
. O
 
For O
more O
difficult O
targets O
, O
man-in-the-middle O
attacks O
can O
be O
used O
. O
 
These O
can O
be O
performed O
either O
at O
the O
same O
physical O
location O
, O
posing B-Action
as B-Modifier
a B-Entity
genuine I-Entity
Wi-Fi I-Entity
hotspot I-Entity
or O
through O
supply O
chain O
attacks O
. O
 
This O
can O
enable O
the B-Entity
attacker I-Entity
to O
swap B-Action
an B-Entity
update I-Entity
of I-Entity
legitimate I-Entity
software I-Entity
for B-Modifier
a B-Entity
maliciously I-Entity
crafted I-Entity
version I-Entity
. O
 
Once B-Modifier
the B-Entity
victim I-Entity
installs I-Entity
the I-Entity
genuine I-Entity
looking I-Entity
update I-Entity
, O
the B-Entity
attacker I-Entity
effectively O
gains B-Action
control B-Entity
over I-Entity
the I-Entity
computer I-Entity
. O
 
Due O
to O
the O
complexity O
of O
such O
an O
attack O
, O
they O
are O
rarely O
used O
. O
 
Depending O
on O
the O
skills O
of O
the O
attacker O
and O
the O
time O
available O
, O
the O
attacker O
might O
also O
attack O
systems O
at O
the O
perimeter O
, O
such O
as O
Web O
servers O
, O
and O
try O
to O
break O
in O
from O
there O
. O
 
The O
malware O
used O
is O
not O
always O
sophisticated O
. O
 
Sometimes O
a B-Entity
regular I-Entity
off-the-shelf I-Entity
back I-Entity
door I-Entity
Trojan I-Entity
is B-Action
used I-Action
. O
 
In O
these O
cases O
the O
person O
behind O
the O
malware O
orchestrating O
the O
commands O
is O
what O
makes O
the O
difference O
between O
a O
targeted O
attack O
and O
a O
broad O
generic O
infection O
. O
 
Having O
said O
this O
, O
on O
very O
unique O
targets O
, O
we O
will O
often O
see O
the O
use O
of O
a O
specifically O
designed O
piece O
malware O
, O
such O
as O
in O
the O
case O
of O
Stuxnet O
. O
 
Depending O
on O
the O
protection O
measures O
implemented O
by O
the O
target O
, O
the O
attackers O
may O
also O
digitally O
sign O
their O
malware O
creation O
. O
 
In O
the O
past O
there O
have O
been O
quite O
a O
few O
cases O
where O
code O
signing O
certificates O
were O
stolen O
and O
later O
misused O
to O
sign O
malware O
in O
order O
to O
pass O
it O
unnoticed O
to O
high O
value O
targets O
. O
 
Once O
the O
attacker O
has O
a O
foothold O
on O
one O
system O
, O
the O
next O
step O
is O
to O
create O
a O
plan O
for O
lateral O
movement O
through O
the O
network O
until O
the O
interesting O
data O
is O
found O
. O
 
With O
more O
specialized O
teams O
of O
attackers O
, O
we O
can O
often O
observe O
that O
the B-Entity
infected I-Entity
system I-Entity
is B-Action
first I-Action
analyzed I-Action
to B-Modifier
ensure B-Entity
that I-Entity
it I-Entity
is I-Entity
of I-Entity
interest I-Entity
to I-Entity
them I-Entity
. O
 
With O
watering O
hole O
attacks O
especially O
, O
it O
can O
happen O
that O
computers O
that O
were O
not O
targeted O
get O
infected O
. O
 
Infected O
computers O
need O
to O
be O
assessed O
by O
the O
attacker O
and O
, O
if O
necessary O
, O
removed O
to O
keep O
the O
profile O
, O
and O
with O
that O
the O
chances O
of O
exposure O
, O
low O
. O
 
One O
of O
the O
obvious O
tasks O
performed O
by O
attackers B-Entity
is O
to O
install B-Action
key B-Entity
loggers I-Entity
, O
dump B-Action
local B-Entity
credentials I-Entity
, O
search B-Action
local B-Entity
storage I-Entity
for B-Modifier
saved B-Entity
accounts I-Entity
and O
sniff B-Action
the B-Entity
network I-Entity
for B-Modifier
passwords B-Entity
. O
 
Any O
account O
detail O
can O
be O
useful O
to O
them O
. O
 
Domain O
administrator O
passwords O
are O
of O
especially O
high O
value O
, O
as O
they O
can O
help O
greatly O
in O
moving O
further O
through O
the O
Intranet O
. O
 
Often B-Entity
small I-Entity
scripts I-Entity
or I-Entity
even I-Entity
manual I-Entity
commands I-Entity
are B-Action
used I-Action
to B-Modifier
comb B-Entity
through I-Entity
local I-Entity
files I-Entity
and I-Entity
create I-Entity
network I-Entity
mappings I-Entity
. O
 
Simple O
system O
commands O
can O
help O
the B-Entity
attacker I-Entity
to O
learn B-Action
about B-Modifier
installed B-Entity
security I-Entity
tools I-Entity
, I-Entity
saved I-Entity
links I-Entity
to I-Entity
internal I-Entity
platforms I-Entity
and I-Entity
local I-Entity
address I-Entity
books I-Entity
. O
 
Once O
new O
systems O
are O
identified O
the O
attacker O
will O
attempt O
to O
hop O
onto O
them O
as O
well O
. O
 
In O
some O
instances O
they B-Entity
might O
even O
use B-Action
zero-day B-Entity
vulnerabilities I-Entity
to B-Modifier
spread B-Entity
further I-Entity
into I-Entity
the I-Entity
network I-Entity
. O
 
One O
method O
which O
is O
gaining O
more O
relevance O
is O
the O
hijacking B-Action
of O
local B-Entity
software I-Entity
distribution I-Entity
systems I-Entity
for B-Modifier
further B-Entity
distribution I-Entity
. O
 
This O
can O
either O
be O
proprietary O
systems O
, O
such O
as O
the O
case O
of O
Trojan.Jokra O
in O
South O
Korea O
, O
or O
OS-specific O
, O
such O
as O
hijacking O
Windows O
Update O
, O
in O
the O
case O
of O
Flamer O
. O
 
Once O
the O
attackers O
have O
successfully O
managed O
to O
create O
and O
distribute O
their O
own O
package O
, O
they B-Entity
can O
easily O
infect B-Action
all B-Entity
connected I-Entity
systems I-Entity
at B-Modifier
once B-Entity
. O
 
Especially O
in O
cases O
of O
wiping O
attacks O
, O
such O
Trojan.Jokra O
, O
this O
is O
a O
very O
efficient O
way O
to O
disrupt O
as O
many O
computers O
as O
possible O
. O
 
If O
the O
target O
is O
assumed O
to O
be O
in O
a O
separated O
network O
not O
connected O
to O
the O
Internet O
, O
the B-Entity
malware I-Entity
used O
might O
try O
and O
autonomously B-Action
infect I-Action
removable B-Entity
drives I-Entity
, I-Entity
like I-Entity
USB I-Entity
sticks I-Entity
, I-Entity
or I-Entity
project I-Entity
files I-Entity
for I-Entity
PLCs I-Entity
. O
 
This O
could O
allow O
the B-Entity
malware I-Entity
to O
be O
manually O
introduced B-Action
to B-Modifier
the B-Entity
destination I-Entity
network I-Entity
, O
without O
the O
knowledge O
of O
the O
carrier O
, O
essentially O
jumping B-Action
air B-Entity
gaps I-Entity
into B-Modifier
isolated B-Entity
networks I-Entity
. O
 
At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
discovery O
phase O
the B-Entity
attackers I-Entity
should O
know B-Action
the B-Entity
internals I-Entity
of I-Entity
the I-Entity
infected I-Entity
networks I-Entity
and O
have O
identified B-Action
systems B-Entity
with I-Entity
interesting I-Entity
data I-Entity
or I-Entity
with I-Entity
connected I-Entity
industrial I-Entity
control I-Entity
systems I-Entity
. O
 
The O
capture O
and O
exfiltration O
phases O
are O
not O
always O
present O
. O
 
If O
the O
sole O
goal O
of O
the O
attackers O
is O
to O
cause O
a O
disruption O
they O
may O
directly O
jump O
to O
a O
destructive O
payload O
. O
 
However O
, O
in O
most O
cases O
information O
is O
extracted O
first O
, O
which O
in O
turn O
allows O
the O
sabotage O
to O
be O
constructed O
more O
efficiently O
at O
a O
later O
phase O
. O
 
In O
this O
phase O
the B-Entity
interesting I-Entity
data I-Entity
is B-Action
gathered I-Action
and O
sent B-Action
back I-Action
to B-Modifier
the B-Entity
attackers I-Entity
. O
 
This O
can O
be O
done O
with O
different O
levels O
of O
sophistication O
. O
 
The B-Entity
simple I-Entity
attacks I-Entity
compress B-Action
the B-Entity
files I-Entity
and O
upload B-Action
them B-Entity
through B-Modifier
FTP B-Entity
or O
through B-Modifier
a B-Entity
HTTP I-Entity
POST I-Entity
request I-Entity
to I-Entity
a I-Entity
remote I-Entity
drop I-Entity
server I-Entity
. O
 
More B-Entity
sophisticated I-Entity
attackers I-Entity
obfuscate B-Action
the B-Entity
data I-Entity
by B-Modifier
XOR-ing B-Entity
it I-Entity
, I-Entity
encrypting I-Entity
it I-Entity
with I-Entity
proper I-Entity
asymmetric I-Entity
encryption I-Entity
or I-Entity
embedding I-Entity
it I-Entity
into I-Entity
media I-Entity
files I-Entity
using I-Entity
steganography I-Entity
to B-Modifier
hide B-Entity
the I-Entity
data I-Entity
from I-Entity
traffic I-Entity
inspection I-Entity
. O
 
In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
the O
amount O
of O
data O
sent O
and O
the O
timing O
can O
be O
chosen O
in O
a O
smart O
way O
. O
 
For O
example O
, O
some B-Entity
malware I-Entity
samples I-Entity
will O
send B-Action
the B-Entity
data I-Entity
in B-Modifier
smaller B-Entity
bursts I-Entity
so B-Modifier
as I-Modifier
not B-Entity
to I-Entity
swamp I-Entity
the I-Entity
network I-Entity
or I-Entity
generate I-Entity
network I-Entity
spikes I-Entity
that I-Entity
might I-Entity
attract I-Entity
attention I-Entity
. O
 
Since O
most O
employees O
use O
laptops O
, O
the B-Entity
malware I-Entity
can O
use B-Action
location B-Entity
awareness I-Entity
to B-Modifier
detect B-Entity
if I-Entity
the I-Entity
compromised I-Entity
computer I-Entity
is I-Entity
outside I-Entity
of I-Entity
the I-Entity
corporate I-Entity
network I-Entity
and O
send B-Action
the B-Entity
data I-Entity
once B-Modifier
it B-Entity
's I-Entity
directly I-Entity
connected I-Entity
to I-Entity
the I-Entity
Internet I-Entity
, I-Entity
such I-Entity
as I-Entity
from I-Entity
a I-Entity
Wi-Fi I-Entity
hotspot I-Entity
at I-Entity
an I-Entity
airport I-Entity
. O
 
This O
might O
allow O
the B-Entity
traffic I-Entity
to O
bypass B-Action
perimeter B-Entity
security I-Entity
and O
receive B-Action
less B-Entity
scrutiny I-Entity
. O
 
In O
some O
instances O
the O
infected O
computer O
might O
not O
have O
a O
direct O
connection O
to O
the O
Internet O
. O
 
In O
such O
cases O
, O
a B-Entity
previously I-Entity
compromised I-Entity
computer I-Entity
in I-Entity
the I-Entity
DMZ I-Entity
can O
act B-Action
as B-Modifier
a B-Entity
proxy I-Entity
, O
forwarding B-Action
all B-Entity
the I-Entity
collected I-Entity
data I-Entity
. O
 
This O
is O
when O
any O
destructive O
payload O
is O
launched O
. O
 
If O
the O
attackers O
are O
only O
after O
information O
this O
phase O
might O
not O
happen O
at O
all O
. O
 
The O
targets O
and O
the O
goals O
for O
disruption O
attacks O
can O
be O
very O
different O
, O
there O
is O
no O
such O
thing O
as O
one- O
size-fits-all O
for O
disruption O
attacks O
. O
 
For O
example O
, O
Stuxnet O
was O
tailored O
to O
attack O
a O
specific O
uranium O
enrichment O
facility O
and O
would O
not O
work O
against O
a O
different O
target O
. O
 
In O
recent O
times O
, O
wiper O
Trojans O
have O
been O
popular O
in O
attacks O
against O
the O
energy O
sector O
. O
 
The B-Entity
malware I-Entity
deletes B-Action
all B-Entity
files I-Entity
on I-Entity
a I-Entity
computer I-Entity
and O
then O
deletes B-Action
the B-Entity
master I-Entity
boot I-Entity
record I-Entity
, O
rendering B-Action
the B-Entity
computer I-Entity
unusable B-Entity
. O
 
This O
can O
happen O
on O
any O
operating O
systems O
and O
we O
have O
seen O
scripts O
for O
different O
UNIX O
